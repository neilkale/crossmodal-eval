This style focuses on depicting subjects as they appear in everyday life without embellishment or interpretation.\n\nThe second image, showing a lively street scene with somewhat abstracted and expressive brushwork, aligns more with the Impressionism or Expressionism movements, which capture moments with a focus on light and movement rather than precise realistic detail.\n\nThe third image, a portrait with detailed rendering of facial features and textures, also aligns with the Realism movement.

The brushwork and the somewhat muted color palette suggest a style that leans towards Impressionism, which is characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities, and inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience.\n\n- The third image employs bright colors and a playful, somewhat exaggerated depiction of urban life, aligning more with styles like Pop Art or even elements of Cubism in its abstract and geometric interpretation of reality.\n\nGiven this analysis, the second image (Choice A) shares a closer stylistic approach to Realism as seen in the first image, compared to the third image.
