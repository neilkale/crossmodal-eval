The focus is on the texture and the deep crevices of the ice.\n\nThe second image shows a broader landscape of ice with some areas covered in snow and others showing blue ice, but the perspective is more distant compared to the first image. The ice formations are less jagged and more spread out.\n\nThe third image presents a very structured and linear perspective of ice formations, with a clear path or crack running through the center, leading to the horizon. The formations here are more uniform and the image has a different feel due to its symmetry and the direction of the crack.\n\nComparing these descriptions, the second image (B) is more similar to the first one because it maintains the focus on the ice formations, though from a slightly different perspective. The third image, while also depicting ice, has a distinctly different composition and structure, focusing on linearity and symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(B) the third image.",
