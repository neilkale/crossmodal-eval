The third image is a triangle with a dot inside it again.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the presence of the dot alternates between the first and third images, while the second image is always without the dot.\n\nNow, let's look at the second row of images:\n\n1. The first image is a square divided into 4 smaller squares.\n2. The second image is a diamond shape divided into 8 smaller diamond shapes.\n\nWe need to find a pattern in these images as well:\n\n- The first image (square) has 4 smaller squares.\n- The second image (diamond) has 8 smaller diamond shapes.\n\nIf we consider the number of smaller shapes, it seems like the number doubles each time: 4 to 8.\n\nGiven this pattern, we should look for an image in the bottom row that follows the same doubling pattern in terms of the number of smaller shapes.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n(A) Picture A shows a shape with 16 smaller shapes.\n(B) Picture B shows a shape with 32 smaller shapes.\n(C) Picture C shows a shape with 16 smaller shapes.\n(D) Picture D shows a shape with 32 smaller shapes.\n\nSince the pattern suggests a doubling, both A and C have 16 smaller shapes, but we need to choose the one that fits the sequence correctly.
