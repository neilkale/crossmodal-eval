The reference point (REF) appears to be near the tip of the spoon where it curves upward.\n\n2. **Second Image**: The blue spoon is now being used to scrape an egg, which is resting on a textured surface. The red-circled points (A, B, C, D) are marked along the spoon.\n\n3. **Action Analysis**:\n   - The reference point (REF) in the first image is near the tip of the spoon, where it curves upward.\n   - In the second image, the action involves scraping the egg, so the point that corresponds to the tip of the spoon should be close to the area where the scraping occurs.\n\n4. **Corresponding Point Selection**:\n   - **Point A**: This point is at the tip of the spoon, where it curves upward, similar to the reference point in the first image.\n   - **Point B**: This point is further down the handle of the spoon.\n   - **Point C**: This point is closer to the middle of the handle.\n   - **Point D**: This point is near the end of the handle, where the spoon is being held.\n\nBased on this analysis, the point that corresponds to the reference point (REF) in the first image when using both items for the action \"Scrape\" is:\n\n**(A) Point A**\n",
