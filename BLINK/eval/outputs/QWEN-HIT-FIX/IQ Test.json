The third row shows three shapes: a rectangle, a cross, and a question mark.\n\nWe need to identify a pattern in these rows and apply it to find the correct shape for the question mark.\n\nLet's break down the pattern:\n- In the first column, we have two circles, then a star, and finally a rectangle.\n- In the second column, we have two circles, then a pentagon, and finally a cross.\n- In the third column, we have an 8, then another star, and the question mark.\n\nThe pattern seems to alternate between two types of shapes:\n- Circles (first and second columns)\n- Stars (first and third columns)\n\nFollowing this alternating pattern, the third column should continue with stars since the first and third columns already have stars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(A) picture A",
