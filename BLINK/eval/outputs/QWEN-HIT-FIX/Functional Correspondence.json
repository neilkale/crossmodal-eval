Both Point A and Point D are located near the wide, flat end of the spoon, which might provide more surface area for applying force compared to the handle.\n\nSince Point A is closer to the wide, flat end than Point D, it seems like a better candidate for applying the necessary force to pull out a nail.\n\nTherefore, the corresponding point for the reference point in the first image is:\n**(A) Point A**",
