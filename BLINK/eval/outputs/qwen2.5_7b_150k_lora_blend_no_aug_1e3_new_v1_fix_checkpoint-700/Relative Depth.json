The point labeled \"A\" appears to be further away from the camera compared to the point labeled \"B\". This can be inferred because the point \"A\" is smaller in size relative to the rest of the scene, while the point \"B\" is larger and more prominent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(B) B is closer",
