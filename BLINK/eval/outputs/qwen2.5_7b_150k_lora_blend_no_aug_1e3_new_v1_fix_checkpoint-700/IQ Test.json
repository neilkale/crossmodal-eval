The circles are arranged in such a way that they form a specific pattern when viewed from the top.\n\n2. **Understand the folding process**: When the paper is folded into a cube, each face of the cube will have one circle on it. We need to ensure that the arrangement of these circles on the faces of the cube matches the pattern we see in the original image.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: When unfolded, this option does not match the pattern of the original image. The circles do not align correctly with the pattern seen in the original image.\n   - **Option B**: When unfolded, this option also does not match the pattern of the original image. The circles do not align correctly with the pattern seen in the original image.\n   - **Option C**: When unfolded, this option matches the pattern of the original image. The circles align correctly with the pattern seen in the original image.\n   - **Option D**: When unfolded, this option does not match the pattern of the original image. The circles do not align correctly with the pattern seen in the original image.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) picture C",
