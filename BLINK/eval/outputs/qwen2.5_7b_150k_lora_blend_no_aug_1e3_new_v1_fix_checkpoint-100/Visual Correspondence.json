The first image has a dark background with blue lights, while the second image has a lighter background with more varied colors (blue, white, and yellow).\n2. The statue appears to be illuminated differently in both images, but the overall structure and features remain consistent.\n\nNow, let's look at the red-circled points:\n- In the first image, the REF point is located near the top left corner of the blue-lit area.\n- In the second image, we need to find a corresponding point that matches the location of REF in the first image.\n\nBy comparing the positions of the red circles in both images:\n- Point A is located near the bottom right corner of the statue.\n- Point B is located near the top left corner of the statue, similar to where REF was in the first image.\n- Point C is located near the top center of the statue.\n- Point D is located near the bottom center of the statue.\n\nBased on the position of the REF point in the first image and its similarity to Point B in the second image, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Point B",
