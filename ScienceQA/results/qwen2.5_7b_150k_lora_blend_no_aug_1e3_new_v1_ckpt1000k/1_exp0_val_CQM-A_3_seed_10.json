    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\" Jackhammers are known for being extremely loud, so the phrase implies that Mr. Herrera's snoring is quite noisy.",
    "7": "The answer is B. armored catfish.\n\nIn the image, we can see a close-up view of a sturgeon's mouth, which is adapted for bottom feeding. The question asks us to identify another animal with a similar mouth adaptation. Among the given options, the armored catfish is known for its bottom-feeding behavior and has a mouth that is adapted for this purpose as well. Therefore, the correct answer is B. armored catfish.",
    "8": "The answer is A. \n\nThis is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"to create\"), making it a complete thought or independent clause. It can be considered a run-on sentence as it lacks proper punctuation, but it is still a grammatically correct sentence. To make it a sentence fragment, it would need to be separated into two sentences or have appropriate punctuation added.",
    "13": "The answer is C. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n\nWendy's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This experiment aimed to determine if increasing the nutrient supply to the bacteria would result in a 20% increase in insulin production. By comparing the insulin production levels between the two groups of bacteria, Wendy could assess whether her hypothesis that adding extra nutrients would lead to increased insulin production was supported or refuted. Therefore, the test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. Options A and B are not directly related to the specific goal of Wendy's test, which was to evaluate the effect of additional nutrients on insulin production.",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title of the play. In titles, words are typically capitalized, and spaces between words are kept as they appear in the original text. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.",
    "16": "The answer is B.\n\nThe passage describes the climate of Chicago, as it refers to the pattern of weather in the city rather than describing the current atmospheric conditions at a specific time. The statement that \"Chicago is known as The Windy City\" indicates that the city experiences strong winds on average, but the fact that the wind only blows at about 10 miles per hour on average suggests that the city has a consistent pattern of wind, which is characteristic of its climate. Therefore, the passage is describing the climate of Chicago.",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns. \n\nSince Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, she has two copies of the dominant allele H. According to the context provided, the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). Therefore, Daffodil will express the dominant phenotype, which is having horns.",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon.\n\nIn the image, we can see a bald eagle with its talons extended towards a fish in the water. This indicates that the eagle's feet are adapted for grabbing prey, as they are sharp and strong, allowing the bird to catch and hold onto its food. \n\nWhile the question asks for an example of another animal with feet adapted for grabbing prey, it does not provide any specific options. However, based on the context given, the New Zealand falcon is known for having feet adapted for catching prey, similar to the bald eagle. The New Zealand falcon is a bird of prey native to New Zealand and is known for its hunting skills, using its sharp talons to catch small birds and insects. Therefore, option B, New Zealand falcon, would be the correct answer if the question had provided this option.",
    "36": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Mars using the given data:\n\n- Volume of Jupiter = 1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mars = 1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Jupiter's volume is compared to Mars' volume:\n\n(1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3) / (1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3) \u2248 8.79 x 10^3\n\nThis means that Jupiter's volume is approximately 8,790 times larger than Mars' volume. Since 8,790 is greater than 10,000, the statement \"Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars\" is true.\n",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we can say that the raindrops \"kissed\" the fans' cheeks to give them a more vivid and emotional description of the scene.",
    "52": "The answer is C. \n\nEarthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.",
    "55": "The answer is A. Yes, Lithops bromfieldii is made up of many cells. \n\nLithops bromfieldii belongs to the plant kingdom, and plants are multicellular organisms. This means that they are composed of numerous cells that work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems. In the case of Lithops bromfieldii, each individual leaf is made up of many cells, and the entire plant is composed of multiple leaves and other structures, all of which are made up of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that Lithops bromfieldii is indeed made up of many cells.",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture.\n\nThe image shows a red-tailed hawk with its sharp, hooked beak that is adapted to tear through meat. While the red-tailed hawk is known for its diet of fish, mammals, and other birds, it is not the only bird with such an adaptation. The Cape vulture, another bird of prey, also has a similar beak shape that is adapted to tearing through meat. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" contradicts the observation that the pug seems to sleep all day. This creates a humorous effect by using irony to highlight the contrast between the pug's appearance and its actual behavior.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence refers to the biblical story of the prodigal son, found in Luke 15:11-32, where a son leaves his father\u2019s house and squanders his inheritance, only to return home with humility and repentance. This story is often used as an allegory for the forgiveness and redemption offered by God.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 30 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 114 to 228 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as it is closer to the actual capacity of a car's gas tank.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho. \n\nIn the map, Idaho is located in the northern part of the United States, while Alabama, South Carolina, and Oklahoma are situated further south. Therefore, Idaho is the state that is farthest north among the given options.",
    "74": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option provides specific context about where and how Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, indicating that it was learned rather than an innate or inherited trait. Option A does not provide any information about the acquisition process but instead describes a consequence of knowing how to build a fire. Therefore, option B is more relevant to the question as it directly addresses the source of the acquired skill.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft.\n\nAll three objects - soccer shorts, jello, and apron - can be considered soft. Soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a soft gelatin dessert, and an apron is typically made of soft material like cotton or polyester. None of these objects are bouncy or hard.",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.",
    "81": "The answer is B.",
    "82": "The answer is B. sturgeon.\n\nThe image shows an armored catfish with its mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Since the question asks for another animal whose mouth is also adapted for bottom feeding, we can infer that the sturgeon, which is known to be a bottom feeder, would have a similar adaptation. On the other hand, the clown triggerfish is not typically associated with bottom feeding and does not have a mouth adapted for this purpose.",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 41\u00b0F is equivalent to approximately 5\u00b0C, which would be considered a cold temperature. On a cold, rainy day, the temperature is likely to be around or below 5\u00b0C, making option B the better estimate. Option A, 41\u00b0C, is much warmer than what one would expect on a cold, rainy day.",
    "101": "The answer is B. Sour. Both limes and dill pickles are known for their sour taste.",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consuming the lichen, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is not shown to be consumed by any other organism in the food web, so it is likely a producer or decomposer.",
    "113": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine the speed of each ship, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor all three options, the time taken by each ship is 10 hours. Now let's calculate the speed for each option:\n\n(A) For the ship that moved 555 kilometers west:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{555 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 55.5 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\n(B) For the ship that moved 95 kilometers south:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{95 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 9.5 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\n(C) For the ship that moved 460 kilometers south:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{460 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 46 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Ship A: 55.5 km/h\n- Ship B: 9.5 km/h\n- Ship C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is Ship B, which moved 95 kilometers south in 10 hours.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur.\" This is because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in her having short fur as the dominant trait.",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath.\" contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so,\" making it a compound sentence. Option A is a simple sentence as it only contains one independent clause.",
    "124": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four squares contain the genotype ee, meaning that all of the offspring will have black eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0.",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Rosa's father has brown eyes. He passed this trait down to Rosa\" provides evidence that Rosa inherited the brown eye trait from her father. This is because the trait of brown eyes is determined by genetics, and if Rosa's father has brown eyes, it suggests that he carries the gene responsible for brown eyes. Since Rosa received this gene from her father, she would also have brown eyes, supporting the conclusion that she inherited the trait. Option A does not provide any direct evidence of inheritance, as it only mentions Rosa's hair being the same color as her eyes, which could be coincidental or due to other factors.",
    "148": "The answer is A.",
    "150": "The answer is B. axial skeleton.\n\nThe image shows a skeleton with blue coloring, highlighting the bones that make up the axial skeleton. These bones include the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, which protect vital organs such as the brain and heart, and support the weight of the body. The bones in the appendicular skeleton, which include the bones in the limbs, are not highlighted in the image. Therefore, option B, \"axial skeleton,\" is the correct term that matches the picture.",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, implying that Richard might also be involved in similar illegal activities. This is an attempt to discredit Richard based on the actions of his family member rather than on any evidence related to Richard himself.",
    "160": "The answer is B.\n\nThe passage describes the weather because it talks about the arrival of a storm with dark clouds on the first day of June. This refers to the current atmospheric conditions at that specific time and location, which is characteristic of weather. On the other hand, climate would refer to the long-term patterns of weather in a particular area, such as average temperatures and precipitation levels over an extended period.",
    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction between the acid in the vinegar and the metal in the penny, which results in the removal of the tarnish. This process changes the composition of the tarnish and the penny itself, making it a chemical change.",
    "165": "The answer is B.\n\nThe passage describes the weather because it mentions specific conditions that occurred at a particular time and place, such as the winds blowing at 30 miles per hour in Lhasa. This information provides insight into the current atmospheric conditions, which is characteristic of weather. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a region, so it would not be appropriate to use the term \"climate\" to describe the specific wind conditions mentioned in the passage.",
    "169": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the first and last words on a page. If a word is not between these guide words, it means the word is either before or after them alphabetically. Since \"import\" comes after \"industry,\" it would be found on a page with guide words like \"industry\" and \"injury.\"",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion \"Midas touch\" refers to someone who is exceptionally skilled or fortunate in their endeavors, often implying that they can turn anything into gold. In this context, it suggests that Tyler is successful at all that he does, as he has managed to launch a thriving business and establish a well-respected charity without any special experience or training. This implies that Tyler possesses exceptional skills or luck in his pursuits, much like the mythical figure Midas who could turn everything he touched into gold.",
    "178": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and another idea that provides additional information or explanation (according to many scholars).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence as it contains an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"Although presidential elections take place in early November\"). However, since the question asks for only one correct answer, we choose option A as it is more straightforward and clearly demonstrates the structure of a complex sentence.",
    "206": "The answer is B. True.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Mars and Mercury. According to the table, the volume of Mars is 160 billion km\u00b3, while the volume of Mercury is 60 billion km\u00b3. \n\nTo find out how many times larger Mars' volume is compared to Mercury's, we can divide the volume of Mars by the volume of Mercury:\n\nMars' volume / Mercury's volume = 160 billion km\u00b3 / 60 billion km\u00b3 = 2.67\n\nThis means that Mars' volume is approximately 2.67 times larger than Mercury's volume. Since the statement says that Mars' volume is more than three times as large as Mercury's, it is false.",
    "213": "The answer is C. \"made\" does not rhyme with \"slide\" or \"ride.\"",
    "221": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use the full name with the title or honorific, followed by a comma. Therefore, \"Dear Grandpa Tim\" is the correct format. Option B, \"Dear grandpa Tim,\" omits the title or honorific, making it less formal and appropriate for a letter.",
    "227": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B provides evidence that Alec acquired the trait of knowing how to knit sweaters by learning it in an after-school program, which implies that he gained knowledge or skill through formal instruction. Option A only describes the materials Alec uses to knit, but does not indicate how he acquired the ability to knit sweaters. Therefore, option B is the correct choice as it directly supports the conclusion that Alec acquired the trait of knowing how to knit sweaters.",
    "231": "The answer is B. Noah was upset about staying home. Verbal irony occurs when someone says something that means the opposite of what they actually mean. In this case, Noah is saying that it was \"good luck\" to have to study for a test, but the implication is that he would rather be at the water park with his friends. This suggests that Noah is upset about being stuck studying instead of enjoying himself at the water park.",
    "240": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Cooking a pancake involves the chemical reaction between the ingredients, such as flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder, to form a new substance (the pancake). This process also involves the Maillard reaction, where sugars react with amino acids to produce new flavors and aromas.\n- Rusting on a bicycle frame is a chemical change that occurs due to the oxidation of iron. Iron reacts with oxygen and water to form rust, which is a different compound than iron.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions, making option D the correct choice.",
    "241": "The answer is B. Peregrine falcons have all the bird traits listed above: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and they hatch from eggs with shells. Burmese pythons, on the other hand, do not have feathers, wings, or a beak, and they lay eggs without shells.",
    "247": "The answer is A. \n\nThis passage describes the weather because it refers to a specific event that occurred in Athens, Greece, last night, indicating a particular temperature reading at that moment. Weather is defined as the state of the atmosphere at a given place and time, while climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a certain area. Since the passage provides a single temperature measurement, it is describing the weather rather than the overall climate of the region.",
    "249": "The answer is (B) pelican.",
    "254": "The answer is B. Problem-Solution.\n\nThe text describes a problem (the need to renovate and update the Louvre Palace in Paris) and then presents a solution (I. M.

    "256": "The answer is A. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where Mariana is being discredited based on her brother's actions, even though there is no direct evidence linking Mariana to those speeding tickets. This is an attempt to discredit her character through an association with her family member's behavior.",
    "257": "The answer is B. Alexandrine parakeet. \n\nBoth the scarlet macaw and the Alexandrine parakeet have strong, curved beaks that are adapted to crack open large, hard nuts. This adaptation allows them to access food sources that other birds may not be able to reach, giving them an advantage in their respective habitats. The blue rock pigeon, on the other hand, has a shorter, more pointed beak that is better suited for pecking at small seeds and insects rather than cracking large, hard nuts.",
    "258": "The answer is B. Pollination. \n\nPollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from the male part of a flower (the anther) to the female part of a flower (the stigma). This transfer of pollen is essential for fertilization, which is the fusion of sperm cells with egg cells in order to produce offspring. In the case of conifers like the one shown in the image, wind can carry pollen from male cones to female cones, allowing for pollination to occur. Once the pollen lands on the female cone, it can germinate and grow into a tube that delivers sperm cells to the ovules inside the female cone, leading to fertilization and the development of seeds.",
    "262": "The answer is A. stretchy. All three objects - bubble gum, trampoline, and rubber band - share the property of being stretchy. Bubble gum can be stretched to form a bubble, the trampoline allows people to jump and bounce, and a rubber band can be stretched to hold things together or to create tension. None of them are transparent, as they all allow light to pass through them, and none of them are rough, as they are all smooth to the touch.",
    "263": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the image, we can see ice cubes that have been formed from water. This process involves a physical change where the water molecules transition from their liquid state to a solid state without altering their chemical composition. As a result, the ice cubes maintain the same chemical properties as the original water, making this an example of a physical change.",
    "265": "The answer is B. Yes, Chelonoidis nigra is made up of many cells. \n\nChelonoidis nigra, also known as the Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoise, is an animal belonging to the class Reptilia, order Testudines, family Testudinidae, genus Chelonoidis, and species Chelonoidis nigra. As a member of the animal kingdom, it is composed of multiple cells that work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems necessary for its survival. The tortoise's body is made up of various types of cells, including epithelial cells, connective tissue cells, muscle cells, and nerve cells, among others. These cells are organized into tissues, such as skin, muscles, and bones, which then form organs like the heart, liver, and brain. The tortoise's complex structure and functions are the result of the coordinated actions of millions of cells working together.",
    "273": "The answer is C. Africa. \n\nThe equator intersects the continent of Africa, as shown in the image. The equator is the line that divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and it passes through the center of the African continent.",
    "274": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters or emails, it is customary to use capitalization for titles and surnames. Therefore, \"Dr.\" should be capitalized in the greeting. Option B correctly follows this rule by using \"Dr.\" with a capital \"D\" and the surname \"Hoffman\" also capitalized. Option A does not capitalize \"Dr.\" and the surname, making it incorrect according to standard conventions.",
    "278": "The answer is A. New Hampshire. \n\nThe colony highlighted in dark green on the map is New Hampshire, one of the original thirteen colonies that formed the United States. The other options listed (Iowa, Massachusetts, and Vermont) are not shown on the map or are not among the original thirteen colonies.",
    "281": "The answer is A. \n\nSince Chanel has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur length gene, she will express the dominant phenotype, which is short fur. This is because the allele F (for short fur) is dominant over the allele f (for long fur). Therefore, even though she has two copies of the dominant allele, her phenotype will be determined by the dominant allele, resulting in short fur.",
    "284": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Lee acquired the trait through various methods such as reading, observing, and experimenting, which are common ways to learn and understand complex subjects like biology. Option A only indicates an interest in human biology but does not provide evidence of how Lee acquired the knowledge or understanding of biology.",
    "290": "The answer is D. The brain coordinates muscle movement by sending signals to the muscles through the nervous system. The brain receives sensory information from the body and sends instructions to the muscles in response to that information. This allows for complex movements such as walking, running, and playing sports. The other organs listed do not play a direct role in coordinating muscle movement. The lungs help with breathing, the heart pumps blood throughout the body, and the skeleton provides structure and support for the body.",
    "299": "The answer is C - Yangtze alligator. \n\nYangtze alligators are a type of reptile, and reptiles are classified as vertebrates because they possess a backbone or spinal column. The other options provided (black widow spider, bull ant, and atlas moth) are invertebrates, meaning they do not have a backbone or spinal column.",
    "302": "The answer is B. \n\nIn thermodynamics, thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles in the object possess, resulting in more thermal energy. Therefore, among the three options provided, the bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 22\u00b0C would have the least thermal energy as it has the lowest temperature compared to the other two options.",
    "309": "The answer is A.\n\nIn Sample A, the average particle speed is 1200 m/s, while in Sample B it is 1000 m/s. Since the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A will be greater than that in Sample B. As temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, Sample A has a higher temperature compared to Sample B.",
    "317": "The answer is A.\n\nThe passage describes the weather because it talks about specific events that happened in Oklahoma, such as large thunderstorms and violent storms during the summer months. These are short-term events that occur within a specific time frame, which is characteristic of weather. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a particular area, so it would not be appropriate to use the term \"climate\" to describe these specific events.",
    "323": "The answer is B.",
    "326": "The answer is B. \n\nThe quotation \"Vanity, not love, has been my folly\" is attributed to Elizabeth in the bubble map.

    "393": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, the sentence \"The stars () as we gazed up in wonder\" can be completed with \"winked\" to give the stars human-like qualities, making them appear to interact with the people observing them. This creates a more engaging and imaginative scene compared to simply stating that the stars \"glowed.\"",
    "394": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this case, the child is pressing the button with his finger, which means that he is applying a force towards the button. Therefore, the direction of the push is away from his finger, as it is the force being applied by him to press the button.",
    "399": "The answer is B. It has a small amount of rain or snow.\n\nThis can be inferred from the image as the Gobi Desert is covered with snow, indicating that it receives a small amount of precipitation, such as rain or snow. Additionally, the presence of snow suggests that the Gobi Desert experiences cold temperatures, which is consistent with its classification as a cold desert ecosystem. The other option, (A), is incorrect because the Gobi Desert does not have warm summers and mild winters; instead, it has cold temperatures year-round.",

    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.",
    "664": "The answer is C. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force would be the same in both pairs. However, since the direction of the force is different (attractive vs. repulsive), it can be said that the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 because the force is directed away from each other, while in Pair 1, the force is directed towards each other.",

    "1925": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of a gas, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of its particles and the temperature. According to the equipartition theorem, the average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, if the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas is higher, then the temperature of the gas will also be higher.\n\nIn this case, both samples have the same average particle speed, but the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B. Since the average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the formula:\n\nKE = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the average kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the average particle speed, we can see that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A will be higher because their masses are greater. As a result, the temperature of Sample A will be higher than the temperature of Sample B.",

    "2540": "The answer is A. Podolsk mole rat. \n\nPodolsk mole rats are known to have teeth that are adapted for gnawing, similar to the nutria in the image. These rodents use their strong incisors to gnaw through tough plant material, which is an important part of their diet. The tamandua, on the other hand, is a type of anteater that primarily feeds on ants and termites using its long, sticky tongue. Its mouth is not adapted for gnawing like the nutria or the Podolsk mole rat.",
    "2542": "The answer is C. Ruben's friend taught him how to fly a kite. This option directly indicates that Ruben acquired the ability to fly a kite through learning from another person, which supports the conclusion that he has the trait of knowing how to fly a kite. Options A and B do not provide evidence that Ruben learned the skill from someone else; they only mention activities or preferences related to flying kites.",
    "2543": "The answer is A. metamorphic.\n\nMarble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This process causes the limestone to change its mineral composition and texture, resulting in a rock with a distinctive white or gray color and a smooth, polished surface. Metamorphic rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks that have been subjected to extreme heat and pressure, causing them to change their structure and composition. Marble is one of the most common types of metamorphic rock and is widely used as a building material due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.",

Both are only physical changes.\n\nPouring milk on oatmeal involves mixing two substances without changing their fundamental properties or creating new substances, making it a physical change. Water evaporating from a puddle is also a physical change because water changes state from liquid to gas (vapor) without forming any new compounds. Neither process involves the creation or destruction of matter, so they are both classified as physical changes.",
    "2550": "The answer is A. Richmond.",
    "2553": "The answer is A. Precipitation does not change much from month to month.\n\nExplanation: The bar graph shows the average monthly precipitation in Charlotte, North Carolina. By examining the heights of the bars, we can see that the precipitation values are relatively close to each other across different months. This indicates that there is little variation in the average monthly precipitation throughout the year. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because January is not the month with the highest average precipitation; it appears to be around March or April. Option C is also incorrect as June seems to have slightly lower average precipitation compared to July.",

This means that the snowboards with wax removed served as the control group, while the snowboards with wax added served as the experimental group. The control group allows researchers to compare the results of the experiment to a baseline, which helps them determine the effect of the independent variable (in this case, the presence or absence of wax). By comparing the times it took for Jeanette to ride down the hill with and without wax, Bryant can determine whether the application of wax had any effect on the speed of the snowboarders.",
    "2761": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the evidence provided in the text, the barrel cactus is described as a producer in its ecosystem, meaning it makes its own food through photosynthesis. It uses energy from sunlight to produce food within its cells, which is characteristic of plants that perform photosynthesis. On the other hand, the crown-of-thorns starfish is described as a consumer, eating other organisms for food, which is not related to photosynthesis. Therefore, the barrel cactus is the correct choice for the photosynthetic organism.",

    "4085": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of the particles. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can focus on comparing their masses and speeds.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average particle speed is 1,000 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 26 u and the average particle speed is 820 m/s.\n\nSince the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, and the average particle speed in Sample A is also greater than the average particle speed in Sample B, it means that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher than the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B.\n\nAs temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, Sample A has a higher temperature compared to Sample B.

This process is a chemical change.\n- Cells using oxygen to break down sugar is known as cellular respiration, which is a metabolic process that involves the breakdown of glucose into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP. This process also involves chemical reactions, making it a chemical change.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions, so they share the characteristic of being chemical changes.",
    "4982": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of each sample, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed is the same (\\( 1,100 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)). However, the masses of the particles are different:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 44 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 26 u\n\nSince the average particle speed is the same in both samples, the difference in temperature will be determined by the difference in the masses of the particles. The sample with the heavier particles (Sample A) will have a higher average kinetic energy because the mass term in the equation for average kinetic energy is squared. Therefore, the temperature of Sample A will be higher than that of Sample B.",

    "5151": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Keenan's parents have pale skin. They passed down this trait to Keenan\" provides evidence that Keenan inherited the pale skin trait from his parents. This is because traits are passed down through genes from parents to offspring, and in this case, it is indicated that Keenan's parents have pale skin, suggesting that they likely carried the gene responsible for pale skin, which was then passed onto Keenan. Option A does not provide any information about the inheritance of the trait, as it only mentions that Keenan and his father have dark hair, which is unrelated to the pale skin trait.",
    "5161": "The answer is C. \n\nWith the given supplies, Darnell can investigate the effect of different types of soil on the growth of a specific type of tomato plant. Since he has one bag of potting soil and five identical clay pots, he can use the potting soil as the control group and compare it with other types of soil by planting the same type of tomato seed in each pot. This way, he can determine which type of soil will cause the tomato plant to grow the most fruit.

    "5579": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on their size, shape, and distance apart. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have similar magnetic properties. However, the size and shape of the magnets in Pair 1 are larger than those in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be stronger compared to the magnets in Pair 2. Thus, the statement \"The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs\" is false. \n\nTo determine whether the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 or Pair 1, we need to consider the distance between the magnets. Since the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is 4 inches and the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is also 4 inches, the distance is the same in both pairs. Therefore, the statement \"The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2\" is also false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",

In this case, \"softly\" would appear after \"sting\" if it were present in the dictionary.",
    "5915": "The answer is B. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud because the statement is made to imply the opposite of what it says. The phrase \"as quiet as a jackhammer\" is used to emphasize how loud the snoring must be, given that a jackhammer is known for being extremely noisy.",
    "5916": "The answer is D. H2O\n\nIn the image, there are two red spheres representing oxygen atoms (O), and two white spheres representing hydrogen atoms (H). This indicates that the molecule is water (H2O), as it consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Therefore, option D is the correct chemical formula for this molecule.",
    "5921": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four squares contain the genotype \"Bb\". Since the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b), any offspring with the genotype \"Bb\" will have a normal-sized body. Therefore, the probability that a rat produced by this cross will have a dwarf body is 0/4 or 0%.",

This extra time spent walking could be considered a cost in terms of her time and effort.",
    "6373": "The answer is A. \n\nThe statement \"Nathan has wavy hair\" indicates that Nathan possesses the wavy hair trait. To determine if Nathan inherited this trait, we need to consider the genetic basis of traits. Traits are often passed down through generations via genes, which are inherited from one's parents. If Nathan's biological parents have wavy hair, it suggests that Nathan may have inherited the gene responsible for wavy hair from them. This would support the conclusion that Nathan inherited the wavy hair trait. \n\nOption B does not provide any direct evidence of inheritance since it only mentions Nathan's mother's hair length and his own hair length, without any information about the hair texture or genetics involved. Option C is irrelevant because using a headband to keep hair out of the face does not indicate anything about the genetic inheritance of the hair texture. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice as it provides relevant information supporting the conclusion that Nathan inherited the wavy hair trait.",
    "6374": "The answer is B. The sentence \"Mrs. Hatfield manages the busy office\" uses the present tense because it describes an ongoing action or state that is currently happening. The verb \"manages\" indicates an action that is in progress, and there is no indication of past or future time.",

The sword was positioned so that it could fall on Diogenes at any moment, symbolizing the constant threat of danger that comes with power. This allusion is used in the sentence to suggest that Will's newfound wealth and luxurious lifestyle come with potential risks or threats, much like the sword hanging over Diogenes' head.",

    "7297": "The answer is B. Euphemism. \n\nIn this context, the phrase \"You shouldn't go in the water\" is a euphemism for \"You should not go into the water.\" The euphemism is used to soften or avoid directly stating that Jennifer should not enter the water due to her lack of swimming skills.",
    "7298": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, the word \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense to describe each item in Samantha's collection of handmade pottery as being distinct and one-of-a-kind, reflecting her cultural heritage and individual artistic style. This usage aligns with the traditional definition of \"unique,\" meaning something that is one of a kind or different from others. Option A uses the word \"unique\" in a more figurative sense, referring to Samantha herself as an exceptional artist, which deviates from the traditional definition.",
    "7326": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the given guide words \"cattle\" and \"code,\" the word that would be found between them in a dictionary is \"crumb.\" This is because the words are arranged alphabetically, and \"crumb\" comes after \"cattle\" and before \"code.\"",

    "7345": "The answer is A. \n\nOption A suggests that Mason's biological father has hazel eyes, which implies that Mason may have inherited the trait from him. This is because eye color is often determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to their offspring. However, it is important to note that other factors such as environmental influences or mutations can also play a role in determining eye color. Therefore, while option A provides evidence that Mason might have inherited the trait, it does not definitively prove it.",

    "7718": "The answer is C. \n\nIn the context provided, a community refers to a group of organisms living together in an area and interacting with each other. In this case, the netleaf oak trees, the Mexican spotted owls, and the brush mice all live in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range and interact with each other. Therefore, they form a community within the forest ecosystem. The other options only describe individual species or elements of the environment, rather than a community of organisms.",
    "7723": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and their size. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have the same magnetic strength per unit volume. Therefore, the larger the magnet, the stronger its magnetic field will be. In Pair 2, there are larger magnets compared to Pair 1, so the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be greater than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.",

This test would allow him to determine how steady the parachute was at this specific speed, as he was interested in understanding the potential for the parachute to swing wildly and potentially damage the spacecraft. The test does not provide information about the parachute's performance at different speeds, nor does it assess the impact of the parachute on the spacecraft itself. Therefore, options A and C are not accurate representations of what Marshall's test could show.",
    "7742": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the image, the student is using her finger to press down on a key on the keyboard. This means that she is applying a force in the direction of the key, which is towards her finger. Therefore, the direction of the push is towards her finger.",
    "7745": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are closer together compared to Pair 2, where the distance between the magnets is greater. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases with increasing distance, the magnetic force will be stronger in Pair 1 due to the shorter distance between the magnets.",
    "7747": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Sandeep, its height above the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external forces other than gravity act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon does not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy is directly related to the increase in its kinetic energy due to the fall. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "7748": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Gabriel's parents had straight hair, which implies they likely inherited the trait from their own parents as well. Since straight hair is a genetic trait, it can be passed down through generations.

    "7811": "The answer is A. First, a layer of sand was deposited. Later, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited.\n\nIn Figure 1, we see that a fast-flowing river deposited heavy sediment grains, such as sand, along its banks. This indicates that initially, there was a layer of sand deposited in the area. As the river dried up and the area became a desert, the wind started depositing sediment, including sand and pebbles, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, the sediment deposited in this area changed over time from a layer of sand to a layer of sand and pebbles due to the shift from a river environment to a desert environment.\n",
    "7812": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the given guide words \"splash\" and \"sure,\" the word that would be found between them in a dictionary is \"struck.\" This is because the words are arranged alphabetically, and \"struck\" comes after \"splash\" and before \"sure.\"",

Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n\nIsabella's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This test could show whether the additional nutrients were effective in increasing the production of insulin by the bacteria. If the bacteria that received extra nutrients produced 20% more insulin than the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, it would indicate that the additional nutrients were successful in helping the bacteria produce more insulin. On the other hand, if there was no significant difference in insulin production between the two groups, it would suggest that the additional nutrients were not effective in increasing insulin production. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer based on the information provided. Options B and C are not directly related to the test described in the passage.",
    "7858": "The answer is B. \n\nIn a food chain, producers are organisms that can make their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Producers are typically plants or algae, as they use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which serves as their energy source. In this case, the diatom is a type of algae, so it can produce its own food using photosynthesis. The other organisms in the food chain, such as the midge larva and brown trout, are consumers because they rely on other organisms for their food source.",
    "7864": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the given sentence, \"Mrs. Snyder is an owl,\" the comparison between Mrs. Snyder and an owl is made using a metaphor.

    "8130": "The answer is A. The hotter pot of spaghetti sauce has more thermal energy. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; the higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles in the substance possess, resulting in more thermal energy. Since the two pots of spaghetti sauce are identical except for their temperatures, the one with the higher temperature will have more thermal energy.",
    "8131": "The answer is A. Bufo viridis.",
    "8139": "The answer is B. The allusion to \"Your nose is growing\" is an idiomatic expression that means someone is lying or telling a fib. It is often used as a way to confront someone who is being dishonest or untruthful. In this case, the mother is suggesting that Elise is lying about loading the dishwasher before watching Dancing with the Stars.",
    "8141": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Ben acquired his knowledge of history through reading, which implies that he actively sought out information and developed an interest in the subject. This aligns with the statement that Ben knows a lot about history, as it indicates that he has engaged in learning and studying the topic extensively. Option A, while it may be true, does not provide direct evidence to support the conclusion that Ben has a deep understanding of history; it only states his interest in American history, which could be a subset or specific focus within the broader field of history.",
    "8149": "The answer is B.",
    "8154": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Maura's parents have dark skin, indicating that they likely passed down the trait responsible for dark skin to Maura. This is consistent with the idea that traits can be inherited from one generation to the next through genes. Therefore, it provides evidence supporting the conclusion that Maura inherited the dark skin trait from her parents. Option A does not provide any direct information about Maura's inheritance of the trait, as it only mentions her father's hair color.",
    "8159": "The answer is C. Indiana. \n\nIndiana is located in the midwestern region of the United States, while Pennsylvania, Vermont, and South Carolina are situated further east. Therefore, among the given options, Indiana is the state that is farthest west.",
    "8161": "The answer is A. \n\nSince the driftwood is floating straight down the stream at a constant speed, it means that its velocity (which includes both speed and direction) remains unchanged throughout its motion. Therefore, the driftwood has a constant velocity. Option B is incorrect because if the driftwood were accelerating, its velocity would be changing, which contradicts the given condition of it moving at a constant speed.",
    "8180": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Brad did not inherently know how to identify different fish but rather had to learn this skill, indicating that he acquired the ability through experience or education. Option B does not provide any evidence supporting the conclusion that Brad acquired the trait; it only states that Brad has two pet fish living in a fish tank together, which does not necessarily imply that he has learned to identify different fish.",
    "8182": "The answer is A. North Carolina. \n\nThe map shows the original 13 colonies that were part of the United States during its early history. The colony highlighted in dark green is North Carolina. Michigan was not one of the original 13 colonies, Florida was not settled by the British until much later, and Iowa was not part of the United States until after the Civil War.",
    "8185": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the title of the movie is written in quotation marks, which is the standard format for movie titles. In option B, the title is written with asterisks around it, which is not the correct formatting for movie titles. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

    "8231": "The answer is C. The prime meridian intersects the Indian Ocean.",
    "8246": "The answer is A. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them. In Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is 3 inches, while in Pair 2, the distance is only 1.75 inches. Since the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2. Therefore, the statement that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 is true.",
    "8275": "The answer is A. a pack of gray wolves.\n\nIn the passage, it is mentioned that gray wolves hunt in packs to capture prey animals like elk, white-tailed deer, and bison. Therefore, a pack of gray wolves would be considered a population in the mountains of Yellowstone National Park. The other options describe different species or elements found in the park but do not represent a population.",
    "8280": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Emmet's mother has blue eyes. She passed this trait down to Emmet\" provides evidence that Emmet inherited the blue eye trait from his mother. This is because Emmet's mother is the source of the genetic material that Emmet received, and if she has blue eyes, it suggests that she carries the gene responsible for blue eyes. Therefore, it is likely that Emmet inherited this gene from her, resulting in him also having blue eyes. Option A does not provide any genetic or familial information, so it cannot support the conclusion that Emmet inherited the blue eye trait.",
    "8284": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Bering Land Bridge National Preserve is located in western Alaska, where the climate is characterized by long, cold winters with temperatures often dropping to below freezing. Additionally, the permafrost in the region remains frozen year-round, which affects the soil and vegetation in the area. Therefore, option B better describes the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve ecosystem. Option A is incorrect because it suggests that the preserve has warm summers, which is not accurate for the region.",
    "8287": "The answer is B. 70\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 70\u00b0F is a more common and accurate temperature range for a classroom compared to 70\u00b0C. While both temperatures can be converted between each other using the formula (\u00b0F - 32) * 5/9 = \u00b0C or \u00b0C * 9/5 + 32 = \u00b0F, it is generally easier to understand and communicate in Fahrenheit within the context of a classroom setting. Additionally, most thermometers used in classrooms display temperatures in Fahrenheit.",
    "8289": "The answer is A. If the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C, then Kurt's test would show that the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C. However, the test does not provide any information about how well the weather station would work when it was windy or under other conditions. Therefore, option B cannot be determined based on the given information.",
    "8295": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. According to the inverse square law, the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Therefore, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller, the magnetic force between them will be stronger compared to the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.",
    "8298": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"nauseous\" is used in its traditional sense to describe an unpleasant smell or odor. In option B, \"nauseous\" is used to describe someone feeling sick, which is a more modern usage of the word. Therefore, option A correctly uses the word \"nauseous\" in its traditional sense.",
    "8303": "The answer is A. A sloth's fur helps it dry off quickly.\n\nIn the text, it states that \"Sloths' fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment.\" This means that the sloth's fur helps it blend into its environment, making it harder for predators to spot it. Additionally, the text mentions that \"When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly.\" So, option A is the correct answer as it explains how the sloth's fur helps it dry off quickly. Option C is incorrect because the text does not mention anything about the sloth's fur helping it cling to tree branches. Option B is also incorrect because the text does not mention anything about the sloth's fur protecting its important organs.",
    "8305": "The answer is A. \n\nOption A contains a subject (\"all the doctors and nurses\") and a verb phrase (\"work hard\"), making it a complete sentence. Option B is a fragment because it lacks a subject or a complete thought.",

It is the largest city in Arkansas and serves as the seat of government for the state. The other options provided are incorrect: Albuquerque is the largest city in New Mexico, Fayetteville is a city in Northwest Arkansas but not the capital, and Montgomery is the capital of Alabama.",
    "8314": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them. In Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is shorter than in Pair 2. Since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater, the magnetic force between them will be weaker compared to Pair 1. Therefore, the statement that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 is true.",
    "8316": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the evidence provided in the text, option B describes a yucca plant, which is a photosynthetic organism. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy using carbon dioxide and water. The description mentions that the yucca plant uses carbon dioxide and water to make its food, which is characteristic of photosynthesis. On the other hand, option A describes an echidna, which is an animal and not a photosynthetic organism.",
    "8318": "The answer is C. neither; the samples have the same temperature.\n\nExplanation: Since both samples have the same average particle speed, their average kinetic energies will be equal. Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, if the average kinetic energies of the particles in both samples are equal, then they must have the same temperature.",
    "8323": "The answer is A. Europe.\n\nIn the image, Europe is highlighted in green on the world map. It is located in the northern part of the world, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north.

    "8379": "The answer is A. climax community.\n\nThe image depicts a forest with trees covered in snow, indicating a winter season. The presence of mature deciduous hardwood trees, which lose their leaves during the winter, suggests that the forest has reached its final stage of development, known as the climax community. This stage is characterized by a stable ecosystem where the plant species are well-adapted to the local climate and conditions, and the forest is no longer undergoing significant changes due to disturbances such as fires or human activities. Therefore, option A, \"climax community,\" best describes the scene in the image.",
    "8381": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"factoid\" is used in its traditional sense as a made-up or false piece of information presented as if it were true. The sentence implies that Hassan's knowledge about African wildlife is not reliable because it is based on inaccurate or fabricated information found on unreliable websites.\n\nOption B uses \"factoid\" in a different context, referring to factual pieces of information that are interesting or surprising. This usage is more modern and does not align with the traditional definition of the term.",
    "8389": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this context, the object with the least thermal energy would be the one with the lowest temperature, as thermal energy is directly related to an object's temperature.

    "8390": "The answer is B. \n\nMost scars are caused by accidents during a person's life, which means they are typically acquired rather than inherited. Inherited traits are passed down through genes from parents to offspring, while acquired traits result from environmental factors or experiences that occur during an individual's lifetime. Since scars are usually formed due to injuries or accidents, they fall under the category of acquired traits.",
    "8393": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nIn both cases, there is no change in the chemical composition or structure of the substances involved. Butter melting on a hot day is a physical change where the butter transitions from a solid state to a liquid state due to an increase in temperature. Similarly, sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is also a physical change where particles suspended in the water settle out due to gravity. Neither of these processes involves any chemical reactions that alter the fundamental nature of the substances involved.",

    "8413": "The answer is A. \n\nThis passage describes the weather because it refers to a specific event that occurred recently (over a week ago) at a particular location (Luna's house). Weather is defined as the short-term atmospheric conditions at a given place and time, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. In contrast, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a region, typically averaged over a period of 30 years or more. Since the statement mentions a recent event, it is describing the current weather conditions rather than the long-term climate patterns.",
    "8414": "The answer is C. which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road\n\nThis answer is supported by the information provided in the context, where it states that Carson developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Additionally, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area. Therefore, the test would show which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road, as this is the specific requirement mentioned in the context. Option A is incorrect because the test does not measure the traffic noise level in the concert area. Option B is also incorrect because the test does not measure the percentage of the park shaded by trees.",
    "8419": "The answer is B. \n\nSince \"bolt\" is the guide word that comes after \"beef\" in alphabetical order, any word that starts with a letter between \"b\" and \"l\" would be found on the same page as \"bolt\". Therefore, the word \"blot\", which starts with the letter \"b\", would also be found on the same page as \"bolt\". So, the answer is yes, you would find the word \"blot\" on a dictionary page with the given guide words.",
    "8424": "The answer is B. With the given supplies, Joy can investigate whether sunflowers grow bigger in sunny planter boxes compared to shady planter boxes. This is because she has two planter boxes, one in the sun and one in the shade, which allows her to compare the growth of sunflowers under different light conditions. \n\nOption A cannot be investigated as there is no pot available among the supplies. Option C is not feasible since there is only one type of sunflower seed available, so it would not allow for comparing different types of sunflowers.",
    "8429": "The answer is A. Coral is a living thing because it consists of many tiny organisms called polyps that live together in colonies. These polyps are capable of growth, reproduction, and other life processes, making them classified as living things. \n\nGlobes, the Great Sphinx of Giza, and cell phones are all non-living objects or man-made structures. Globes are typically made of materials like plastic or glass and serve as models of the Earth. The Great Sphinx of Giza is an ancient monument carved out of stone, and cell phones are electronic devices used for communication and entertainment. None of these objects possess the characteristics of life, such as growth, reproduction, or response to stimuli, so they are not considered living things.",
    "8431": "The answer is B.",
    "8434": "The answer is A. Gold bracelet. \n\nGold bracelets are typically made of solid gold or a gold alloy, making them a solid object. Milk and wet paint are liquids, so they would not be classified as solids.",

This makes it a simple sentence.\n\nOption B, \"Mrs. Thornton plants flower seeds, and they blossom in the spring,\" contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\" (\"Mrs. Thornton plants flower seeds\" and \"they blossom in the spring\"). This makes it a compound sentence, not a simple sentence.",
    "8455": "The answer is A. \n\nIn this text, Eddie is using a pun by saying \"impossible to put down\" as a play on words. The phrase \"put down\" can mean both to lay something down or to stop reading something. By saying it's impossible to put down, he implies that the book is so engaging that one cannot stop reading it, even though it might be physically possible to lay the book down. This is an example of a pun, where a word or phrase is used in more than one way to create humor or irony.",
    "8457": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this case, the second sentence fragment is \"Because the festival honors the spirits of family members who have died, many people spend it with family and friends.\" This sentence fragment does not have a subject or a complete thought, making it incomplete and grammatically incorrect.

    "8575": "The answer is (A) fire salamander. \n\nIn the context provided, it is mentioned that the sharpnose-puffer has brightly colored skin that serves as a warning sign to predators due to its toxicity. This is an example of aposematic coloration, where the animal's appearance signals to potential predators that it is harmful or dangerous. The fire salamander also has brightly colored skin, which serves as a warning sign to predators, similar to the sharpnose-puffer. Therefore, both animals' skin is better adapted as a warning sign to ward off predators. However, since the question asks for one option, the answer would be (A) fire salamander. The peppered moth does not have brightly colored skin, so it cannot be the correct answer in this case.",

In this case, we want to complete the sentence with an attribute that gives life or movement to time, making it seem like a living entity. Option B, \"creeps up on you,\" personifies time by giving it the ability to move stealthily and unexpectedly, as if it is a living thing that can sneak up on people. This choice creates a vivid image and conveys the idea that time passes without us realizing it, much like how a sneaky person might approach someone quietly. Option A, \"affects everyone,\" does not use personification because it simply states a fact rather than attributing human-like qualities to time.",

These chemicals react with the tarnish to break it down and remove it, resulting in a cleaner surface. This is also a chemical change.\n\nBoth scenarios involve changes that result in new substances being formed, making them chemical changes rather than physical changes. Heating and cooling can sometimes cause physical changes, but they are not relevant to the given options.",
    "9124": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of the particles. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in temperature will be determined by the difference in the masses of the particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 28 u, while in Sample B, the mass of each particle is 46 u. Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, the particles in Sample B have more kinetic energy per particle compared to those in Sample A. As a result, Sample B has a higher temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) sample B.",

    "9647": "The answer is C. 6 pounds. \n\nThis is because a typical grocery bag usually contains around 6 pounds of groceries, making it a reasonable estimate for the mass of a full bag of groceries. 6 tons would be an extremely heavy load, while 6 ounces is too light to be considered a full bag of groceries.",
    "9658": "The answer is C. beaver.\n\nIn a food web, primary consumers are organisms that feed directly on producers, which are typically plants or algae. In this food web, the beaver is shown to be feeding on the persimmon tree, making it the primary consumer in this ecosystem. The other options are either producers (persimmon tree and silver maple) or secondary consumers (gray fox).",
    "9667": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"Camille and her mom sat on the back porch and watched as the sun sank into the horizon,\" there is a dependent clause (\"and watched as the sun sank into the horizon\") that provides additional information to the independent clause (\"Camille and her mom sat on the back porch\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one independent clause and one dependent clause.\n\nOption B, \"Open and honest communication is the foundation of a healthy relationship,\" is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause without any dependent clauses.",
    "9674": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the image, we can see that the fossil of Glyptodon has front and back limbs, which are clearly visible in the form of bones extending from its body. These limbs are likely used for walking or moving around, as they are characteristic of many animals with similar skeletal structures. Long flippers, on the other hand, would be difficult to observe on this fossil since they are not present in the image.",
    "9679": "The answer is (A) pelican.",
    "9680": "The answer is D. Olympia.",
    "9685": "The answer is A. Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles because it contains more solute particles in the same volume of solvent compared to Solution B.",
    "9691": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"random\" is used in its traditional sense to describe the natural behavior of camels in the wild, where they eat various types of plants without any specific pattern or preference. This usage aligns with the original meaning of the word, which refers to something happening by chance or without a specific order or purpose. Option A uses the word \"random\" in a different context, referring to the sightings of camels in the Southwest, which may not be related to their eating habits.",
    "9696": "The answer is D. Desmond can trade his tomatoes for Tom's broccoli.\n\nIn the image, Desmond has tomatoes in his lunch box while Tom has broccoli. Since Desmond wants broccoli and Tom wants tomatoes, they can trade these items to satisfy their preferences. This way, both Desmond and Tom will end up with the food item they desire, making them happier with their lunches.",
    "9699": "The answer is A. Cherry tree.",
    "9702": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Mr. Dodson's legs were as long as sunflower stalks,\" the phrase \"as long as\" is used to compare the length of Mr. Dodson's legs to that of sunflower stalks, which is an example of a simile. A simile is a figure of speech that compares two different things using the words \"like\" or \"as.\" In this case, it compares the length of Mr. Dodson's legs to the length of sunflower stalks. Option A, on the other hand, uses a metaphor by comparing Mr. Dodson's legs to sunflower stalks, but it does not use the word \"like\" or \"as\" to make the comparison, so it is not a simile.",
    "9708": "The answer is A. hard.",
    "9711": "The answer is B. Phoenix.",
    "9715": "The answer is B. How long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water.\n\nIn the passage, Hunter conducted an experiment by making a sample fabric with 50% cotton and 50% polyester, then putting one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed. This test would help him determine whether the sample fabric met the requirement of drying completely in less than five minutes. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because the test did not measure the time it took for the fabric to absorb one drop of water. Option C is also incorrect as the test did not measure the amount of sweat athletes would produce while wearing the fabric.",
    "9716": "The answer is A. bald eagle.",
    "9723": "The answer is B. Vacuoles are found in plant cells but not in animal cells. Chloroplasts are organelles that perform photosynthesis in plant cells, so they are also not present in animal cells. Animal cells typically contain structures like the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and centrioles.",
    "9729": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Silver jewelry tarnishing involves the reaction between silver and sulfur dioxide or other sulfur compounds in the air, leading to the formation of a black or brown layer on the surface of the silver. This is a chemical change because new substances are formed during the process.\n- Boiling sugar to make caramel involves the dehydration of sugar molecules, where water is removed from the sugar, causing it to undergo a series of chemical reactions that result in the formation of caramel. This is also a chemical change as the sugar molecules transform into different compounds with distinct properties.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions rather than just physical changes, making option D the correct choice.",
    "9730": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Uranus and Saturn. According to the table:\n\n- The volume of Uranus is 68,330 billion km\u00b3.\n- The volume of Saturn is 827,130 billion km\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's calculate one-tenth of the volume of Saturn:\nOne-tenth of Saturn's volume = 827,130 billion km\u00b3 / 10 = 82,713 billion km\u00b3\n\nSince the volume of Uranus (68,330 billion km\u00b3) is less than one-tenth of the volume of Saturn (82,713 billion km\u00b3), the statement is true.\n",
    "9735": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine the temperature shown by the thermometer, you need to look at the scale and the position of the mercury or liquid column within the thermometer. In this case, the mercury column aligns with the 25\u00b0C mark on the scale, indicating that the temperature is 25\u00b0C. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

    "9747": "The answer is B. Euphemism. An euphemism is an indirect or polite way of expressing something that might be considered harsh, blunt, or offensive. In this case, \"old news\" is being used as a euphemism to express that Mark's leaving his job is not surprising or newsworthy because he had been planning it for months.",
    "9748": "The answer is A. \n\nThis is a sentence fragment because it lacks a subject and a complete thought. It starts with \"The Zion Narrows,\" which is a noun phrase, but it does not provide any additional information or complete the thought. To make it a complete sentence, you would need to add a subject and a verb, such as \"is\" or \"are.\" For example: \"The Zion Narrows, a canyon in Utah's Zion National Park, stretches for sixteen miles and, in some areas, narrows to just twenty feet.\"",
    "9752": "The answer is C. New Hampshire.",
    "9755": "The answer is C. Logos (reason).\n\nThe advertisement uses the results of laboratory tests to support its claim that the Vilaplus vacuum picks up more dirt than the leading brand. This appeals to the audience's sense of reason by presenting factual evidence rather than relying on emotional or character-based appeals.",
    "9769": "The answer is A. \n\nThe magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them. In Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the strength of the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2. Therefore, the statement that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 is true.",
    "9771": "The answer is B. Florida. \n\nFlorida is located in the southeastern part of the United States, while Maine is in the northeastern part, Rhode Island is between Massachusetts and Connecticut, and New Jersey is in the mid-Atlantic region. Therefore, Florida is the farthest west among the given options.",
    "9776": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature because it has a higher average particle speed compared to Sample B. Since the mass of the particles in both samples is the same, the average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to their average speed. Therefore, the sample with the higher average particle speed will have the higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.",
    "9779": "The answer is A. \n\nSince \"marry\" is the first word and \"mistake\" is the second word in the given guide words, any word that falls between these two words alphabetically will be found on the same page as \"marry\". Therefore, \"mosquito\" would be the correct choice because it comes after \"marry\" but before \"mistake\" in alphabetical order.",
    "9782": "The answer is C. hard. \n\nAll three objects - tree bark, wool sweater, and sandpaper - share the property of being hard or rough to the touch. Tree bark is typically rough and textured, the wool sweater can be hard if it is tightly woven or has a thick pile, and sandpaper is designed to be abrasive and rough to the touch.",
    "9789": "The answer is A. Straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against. \n\nIn this case, the HR department is presenting their argument as if they are suggesting that employees should spend all their time at the gym, which is a misrepresentation of their actual position. They are actually advocating for free gym memberships to encourage employees to exercise, but the statement implies that they want employees to neglect their work responsibilities entirely. This misrepresentation makes it easier for the argument to be dismissed or countered.",
    "9793": "The answer is C. Cheyenne.\n\nCheyenne is the capital city of Wyoming, located in the central part of the state.

    "9854": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nIn both cases, there is no new substance formed; instead, the properties of the original substances change without altering their fundamental composition. For butter melting on a hot day, the temperature increase causes the butter to transition from a solid state to a liquid state, but it remains butter. Similarly, peeling a banana involves removing its outer skin, which is a physical action that does not alter the banana's internal structure or create a new substance. Therefore, both scenarios represent physical changes rather than chemical ones.",
    "9856": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 2 are larger than those in Pair 1, and the size of a magnet affects its magnetic strength. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields compared to smaller ones. Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be greater than that in Pair 1.",
    "9862": "The answer is B. Apollo's genotype for the coat pattern gene is Aa. This means that Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat (A) and one allele for a black coat (a). Since the allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a), Apollo will express the spotted coat phenotype.",

    "9895": "The answer is B. Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn both cases, heat is used to cook or bake the food items. For baking an apple pie, the oven heats up the pie crust and filling, causing them to rise and become golden brown. Similarly, cooking an egg involves heating it until it sets and becomes firm, typically through frying, boiling, or poaching. Neither process involves cooling as a primary cause; rather, they rely on the application of heat to achieve their respective transformations.",
    "9910": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on their size, shape, and distance apart. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have similar magnetic properties. However, the size and shape of the magnets in Pair 1 are different from those in Pair 2. In Pair 1, there is a larger magnet with a smaller one, while in Pair 2, the magnets are of similar size. Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be stronger than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2. This is because the larger magnet in Pair 1 has more magnetic poles to interact with the smaller magnet, resulting in a stronger magnetic force. Thus, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",

    "9956": "The answer is A. Raleigh.",
    "9964": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. According to the inverse square law, the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Therefore, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller, the magnetic force between them will be stronger compared to the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.",
    "9965": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the image, it can be observed that the De Biesbosch National Park is a wetland ecosystem, which means that it has land that is covered with water during most of the year. Additionally, there are other water ecosystems nearby, such as lakes or rivers, which can be seen in the background of the image. Therefore, option A better describes the De Biesbosch National Park ecosystem. Option B does not accurately describe the ecosystem, as it mentions poor soil quality, which is not evident in the image.",
    "9968": "The answer is B. \n\nIn general, an object with a higher temperature has more thermal energy than an object with a lower temperature. Since the bowl of oatmeal in option B has a higher temperature (80\u00b0F compared to 70\u00b0F), it will have more thermal energy.",
    "9971": "The answer is B. 26 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a paintbrush is typically a small object used for painting, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than millimeters, kilometers, or meters. 26 centimeters is a reasonable length for a paintbrush, as it is shorter than most adult hands but still long enough to reach various areas while painting.",

By using different types of metal sheets, Cameron can determine which type of metal is better at conducting electricity.",
    "10060": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Cassie. \n\nThis is because the seat of the cart is pushing up on Cassie with a force of 1,200N, while Earth's gravity is pulling down on her with a force of 600N. Since these two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. Therefore, the forces on Cassie are balanced, and there is no net force acting on her.",

Therefore, the mutation in the FliG gene affected the structure and function of the FliG protein.",
    "10134": "The answer is A. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n\nAnita's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This test could show whether the additional nutrients were effective in increasing the production of insulin by the bacteria. If the bacteria that received extra nutrients produced 20% more insulin than the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, it would indicate that the additional nutrients were successful in helping the bacteria produce more insulin. On the other hand, if there was no significant difference in insulin production between the two groups of bacteria, it would suggest that the additional nutrients were not effective in increasing insulin production. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the test does not measure the growth rate of the bacteria; it only measures the amount of insulin produced. Option C is also incorrect as the test only involves one type of bacteria, so it cannot determine whether different types of bacteria would require different nutrients to produce insulin.",

    "10152": "The answer is A. plated leaf chameleon.\n\nThe image shows a leaf-mimic grasshopper, which is an animal that is adapted to blend into its environment by resembling dead leaves. The grasshopper's coloration and shape help it to camouflage itself among the leaves, making it difficult for predators to spot it. While there may be other animals that are adapted to blend into their surroundings, the leaf-mimic grasshopper is specifically mentioned in the context of being adapted to be camouflaged among dead leaves. Therefore, option A, the plated leaf chameleon, would be the correct answer as it is another example of an animal that is adapted to blend into its environment by resembling dead leaves. Option B, the snowy owl, is not typically adapted to blend into dead leaves, but rather to blend into snow-covered landscapes.",
    "10153": "The answer is B. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms. In this case, \"something for everyone\" and \"target market\" are contradictory because a target market implies a specific group of people, while \"something for everyone\" suggests a broad appeal. Therefore, the phrase \"something for everyone\" combined with \"target market\" creates an oxymoron.",

    "10382": "The answer is A. Arctic wolf.\n\nArctic wolves are well-adapted to living in cold, snowy environments due to their thick fur coats that provide insulation against the harsh winter conditions. Their white or light-colored fur helps them blend into the snowy landscape, making it easier for them to hunt and avoid predators. This adaptation allows them to survive and thrive in their natural habitat, which is characterized by long, cold winters and short, mild summers. In contrast, the porcupine is not specifically adapted to be camouflaged in the snow; its quills serve as a defense mechanism rather than camouflage.",
    "10383": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Neptune and Earth. According to the table, Neptune's volume is 62,530 billion km\u00b3, while Earth's volume is 1,090 billion km\u00b3. To find out how many times greater Neptune's volume is compared to Earth's, we can divide Neptune's volume by Earth's volume:\n\n62,530 / 1,090 = 57.48\n\nSince 57.48 is more than 50, the statement \"Neptune's volume is more than 50 times as great as that of Earth\" is true.",
    "10392": "The answer is B. A newspaper is considered a good because it is a tangible product that can be physically purchased and consumed. It provides information and entertainment to its readers, but it is not a service as it does not involve providing a service or performing an action for someone else.",

    "10638": "The answer is B. Indianapolis.",
    "10643": "The answer is B. 11 liters. \n\nThis is because a large soup pot typically holds a significant amount of liquid, making it more likely to be measured in liters rather than milliliters. 11 milliliters would be equivalent to only about one tablespoon of liquid, which is far too small for a soup pot. On the other hand, 11 liters is a much more reasonable estimate for the volume of a large soup pot, as it can hold enough liquid to serve multiple people comfortably.",
    "10647": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"Valeria was known among her coworkers for her spartan ways\" refers to the Spartan people, who were known for their strict discipline and simplicity. This allusion comes from Greek history, as the Spartans were an ancient Greek city-state located in the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula.",
    "10652": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Elijah acquired the ability to speak two languages through learning, which supports the conclusion that he has the trait of speaking two languages. Option B does not provide any information about how Elijah acquired the ability to speak two languages; it only mentions his mother's language skills. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice as it directly addresses the acquisition of the trait.",
    "10658": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"can\" is used in its traditional sense as an auxiliary verb expressing ability or capability. Miranda can use your keyboard, indicating that she has the ability to do so. In contrast, option A uses \"can\" to express possibility or permission, which is not its traditional sense.",

    "10663": "The answer is B. The sentence uses a simile because it compares Jayla going down the slide to a penguin using the phrase \"like a penguin.\" A simile explicitly states the comparison between two things by using words such as \"like\" or \"as,\" while a metaphor directly states that one thing is another without using these words.",
    "10664": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Bending a paper clip involves changing its shape without altering its chemical composition or creating new substances. This is a physical change.\n- Breaking a rock in half also involves a change in shape but does not create new substances or alter the chemical composition of the rock. Therefore, it is also a physical change.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because:\n- Cooling is not a factor in either bending a paper clip or breaking a rock in half.\n- Chemical changes involve the creation of new substances or alteration of the chemical composition of materials, neither of which occurs during bending a paper clip or breaking a rock in half.\n- Heating is not necessary to perform either action; both can be done at room temperature.\n\nThus, the correct answer is that both actions are only physical changes.",

    "10673": "The answer is B. The term \"Luddite\" refers to someone who opposes technological change, particularly in manufacturing processes. This term originated from the Luddites, a group of workers in England during the early 19th century who destroyed machinery they believed was threatening their jobs. Therefore, the source of the allusion in the given sentence is British history.",
    "10676": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"it\" is a vague pronoun reference because it is unclear whether \"it\" refers to the skirt or the blouse. To avoid ambiguity, the sentence should specify which item needs to be exchanged. For example, \"If Emily's skirt doesn't match the blouse, she will have to exchange the skirt for another item.\" This clarifies that the skirt is the item being exchanged.",
    "10678": "The answer is A. \n\nSince the objects are identical in all other aspects except for their temperatures, the one with the higher temperature will have more thermal energy. In this case, the bowl of oatmeal at 40\u00b0C has a higher temperature than the bowl of oatmeal at 25\u00b0C, so it has more thermal energy.",
    "10691": "The answer is B. Bald eagle.\n\nThe image shows a close-up of a white-backed vulture with its beak, which is adapted to tear through meat. Since the question asks for another bird with a similar adaptation, the bald eagle would be the correct answer as it is also a scavenger that feeds on dead animals and has a strong, hooked beak that is adapted to tearing through meat. The hoopoe, on the other hand, is a bird that primarily feeds on insects and does not have a beak adapted for tearing through meat.\n",
    "10694": "The answer is A. Chiasmus is a figure of speech where words or phrases are repeated in reverse order to create a parallel structure. In this case, \"That's old news\" and \"He's been planning that for months\" are both reversed versions of each other, making it an example of chiasmus.",
    "10695": "The answer is A. Are eggs more likely to float in fresh water or salty water?\n\nThis is because Dakota's experiment involved comparing the behavior of eggs in both fresh water and salty water. By repeating the process with two more eggs and counting the number of times the eggs floated in each type of water, she was able to determine whether eggs were more likely to float in fresh water or salty water. The other option, (B), is not directly addressed by Dakota's experiment since she did not vary the amount of water in the glasses.",

    "10951": "The answer is B. Chloroplasts are the organelles in plant cells that contain chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for capturing light energy from the sun. This captured energy is then used by the plant to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a type of sugar, through a process called photosynthesis. \n\nChromosomes, on the other hand, are structures found within the nucleus of a cell that contain genetic material, such as DNA. They are involved in the storage and transmission of genetic information but do not directly use energy from sunlight to make sugar. \n\nCell membranes are the outer boundary of a cell that regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell. They do not play a direct role in using energy from sunlight to make sugar. \n\nVacuoles are organelles found in plant cells that store various substances, including water, nutrients, and waste products. They also help maintain the cell's shape and turgor pressure, but they do not use energy from sunlight to make sugar. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Chloroplasts.",

    "11830": "The answer is A. Circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself. \n\nIn this case, Mr. Harding's ability to quit smoking is being used as evidence for his capability to stop smoking, which is essentially restating the same idea without providing any additional support or evidence. This is a classic example of circular reasoning.",
    "11839": "The answer is B. If the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C, then Tom's test would show that the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C. This test was designed to simulate unusually warm weather conditions, so if the weather station performed well under these conditions, it would indicate that it would also perform well in other warm weather situations. On the other hand, option A is incorrect because the test was conducted in a controlled environment without any wind, so it cannot demonstrate how well the weather station would work when it was windy.",
    "11847": "The answer is B. metal. \n\nThe screwdriver in the image appears to be made of metal, as it has a metallic handle and shaft. Wax is not a suitable material for a tool like a screwdriver, as it would not provide the necessary strength and durability required for such an object.",
    "11848": "The answer is A. Thresher sharks have fins, not limbs, they hatch from eggs with no shells, and they can use their tail to hit and stun their prey.

    "11851": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we can say \"At the farmer's market, bright red tomatoes boasted of a bountiful harvest.\" This sentence gives the tomatoes a human-like quality by attributing them with the ability to boast, which is typically associated with humans.",
    "11863": "The answer is B. \n\nText message B is more formal because it uses proper capitalization, punctuation, and includes the title \"Ms.\" before the name, which adds a level of formality to the message. Text message A is less formal as it uses an exclamation point and lacks proper punctuation.",
    "11873": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the food web provided, the black rockfish is shown as being preyed upon by the orca. This means that the matter contained within the black rockfish will eventually be consumed by the orca, and thus, the matter from the black rockfish will move up the food chain to the orca. However, the question asks for the organism that contains matter that eventually moves to the bat star. Since the bat star is shown to be preyed upon by the kelp bass, it can be inferred that the matter from the bat star will move down the food chain to the kelp bass. Therefore, the correct answer is B, the black rockfish.",

Therefore, the answer is B. True.",
    "11904": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the image, the Monongahela National Forest appears to be a lush, green forest with many trees and vegetation. This suggests that it has soil that is rich in nutrients, as well as cold, wet winters. The presence of moss and other plants indicates that the soil is fertile and can support diverse plant life. Additionally, the image shows a stream running through the forest, which implies that the area receives adequate rainfall and has a cool climate. Therefore, option B better describes the Monongahela National Forest ecosystem. Option A is incorrect because the image does not suggest that the soil is poor in nutrients or that there are only a few types of trees.",

    "12095": "The answer is B. Rr. \n\nPeaches has one allele for bright orange cheeks (R) and one allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This combination results in the genotype Rr, where R represents the allele for bright orange cheeks and r represents the allele for pale orange cheeks. Since R is dominant over r, the presence of even one R allele will result in the bright orange cheek phenotype. Therefore, Peaches's phenotype for the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks.",
    "12099": "The answer is B. 16 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a pen is typically a small object that is used to write or draw, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than meters, millimeters, or kilometers. 16 meters is too large for a pen, as it would be much longer than an average person. 16 millimeters is also too short, as it would be less than half the length of a standard pen. 16 kilometers is even more extreme, being far beyond the length of any pen. Therefore, 16 centimeters is the most reasonable and accurate estimate for the length of a pen.",
    "12101": "The answer is C. \"boy\" is not like the others because it refers to a person, while the other options refer to animals.",
    "12102": "The answer is B. This is a declarative sentence because it makes a statement about Ted needing information about zebras for his report.

    "12114": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Max's mother has blue eyes. She passed this trait down to Max\" provides evidence that Max inherited the blue eye trait from his mother. This indicates that the trait is likely genetic in nature, as it was passed down through the family lineage. Option A does not provide any genetic or familial information, so it cannot support the conclusion that Max inherited the blue eye trait.",
    "12118": "The answer is B. Snowy owls have sharp, curved beaks and live in cold places. They have feathers on their feet to protect them from the cold. Mother owls keep their eggs warm by standing on their shells. This description matches all the bird traits mentioned: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and lay eggs with shells. \n\nOption A describes black howler monkeys, which do not have feathers, wings, or lay eggs with shells, so they do not fit the criteria for being classified as birds.",

    "12900": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of the particles. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can focus on comparing their masses and speeds.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 36 u and the average particle speed is 1,000 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average particle speed is 1,100 m/s.\n\nSince the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, but the average particle speed in Sample B is also greater, we cannot definitively say that either sample has a higher average kinetic energy based solely on these values. However, we can infer that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is likely higher due to the increased mass and speed of the particles.\n\nTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, since Sample B has higher average kinetic energies of its particles, it follows that Sample B has a higher temperature compared to Sample A.",

    "12957": "The answer is A. \n\nA sentence fragment is a group of words that expresses an incomplete thought or does not contain a complete subject and predicate. Option A, \"A cheese sandwich with lettuce and tomato,\" is a sentence fragment because it lacks a subject and predicate to form a complete sentence. On the other hand, option B, \"The girls climb on the bars at the playground,\" is a complete sentence as it contains both a subject (\"the girls\") and a predicate (\"climb on the bars at the playground\").",
    "12959": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of the particles. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can focus on comparing their masses and speeds.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 32 u and the average particle speed is 1,100 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 16 u and the average particle speed is 910 m/s.\n\nSince the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, but the average particle speed in Sample A is also greater than the average particle speed in Sample B, we cannot definitively say that either sample has a higher average kinetic energy based solely on these values.\n\nHowever, we know that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, if we assume that the temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles, then Sample A would have a higher temperature because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy due to their greater mass and speed compared to those in Sample B.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: Sample A has the higher temperature.",

    "13568": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- When a rock heats up in a campfire, it undergoes a physical change because its temperature increases without altering its chemical composition or structure. The rock remains the same substance but simply becomes warmer.\n- Mixing sand and water is also a physical change as it involves combining two substances without any chemical reaction occurring. The sand and water remain distinct materials that can be separated again if necessary.\n\nBoth scenarios involve changes that do not result in the formation of new substances, making them physical changes rather than chemical ones.",
    "13569": "The answer is A. which side of the roof got more sun over one day\n\nWayne installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof to measure the amount of sunlight each side received during a sunny summer day. This test would allow him to determine which side of the roof received more sunlight, helping him make an informed decision about where to install the solar panels to maximize their efficiency and minimize costs for his client. Option B is incorrect because the test only measures sunlight for one day, not throughout the entire year. Option C is also incorrect as the test does not involve measuring the number of solar panels that can fit on each side of the roof; it focuses solely on the amount of sunlight each side receives.",
    "13573": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the title of the movie is enclosed in quotation marks, which is the standard format for movie titles.

This process is catalyzed by enzymes within the fruit, leading to changes in flavor, texture, and color.\n- Milk going sour is due to the fermentation of lactose (a sugar found in milk) by bacteria present in the environment or on the surface of the milk. This fermentation produces lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the milk, causing it to become acidic and sour.\n\nIn both cases, the changes involve chemical reactions rather than just physical transformations. Therefore, option D, \"Both are chemical changes,\" is the correct answer.",
    "13893": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases, cells using oxygen to break down sugar and burning food on a stove involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds between molecules. This process is known as a chemical reaction, where new substances are formed from the original reactants. In the case of cells using oxygen to break down sugar, the sugar molecule is broken down into simpler molecules like carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the process. Similarly, when food is burned on a stove, the chemical bonds within the food molecules are broken, releasing heat and producing new substances like carbon dioxide and water vapor. Therefore, both processes are examples of chemical changes.",
    "13898": "The answer is C. a new plant. \n\nDouglas fir seeds are capable of growing into new plants if they find suitable conditions to germinate and establish themselves in their environment. These conditions typically include a moist soil, adequate sunlight, and protection from harsh weather or predators. Once the seed germinates, it will develop into a young tree that will eventually grow into a mature Douglas fir tree. The other options, such as a female cone or a male cone, are not directly related to the growth of a douglas fir seed into a new plant.",

    "13920": "The answer is A. mineral.\n\nBased on the context provided, biotite is described as a pure substance that is naturally occurring, solid, fragile, has a fixed crystal structure, and is not made by organisms. These characteristics align with the definition of a mineral, which is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and an ordered internal structure. Therefore, biotite is classified as a mineral rather than a rock.",
    "13933": "The answer is A. gorilla. \n\nIn the image, there is a fruit bat flying in the air. Fruit bats belong to the order Chiroptera, which includes all bats. While bats are mammals, they are not typically considered as \"mammals\" in the context of the given options. The other option, (B) common toad, is not a mammal but rather an amphibian. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) gorilla, as it is the only mammal among the given options.",
    "13935": "The answer is A. \n\nBoth an inflatable castle and a spring can be considered bouncy because they both have the ability to absorb and release energy, causing them to bounce or rebound after being compressed or stretched. This property is due to their elastic nature, which allows them to return to their original shape after being deformed. While they may also share other properties such as being made of similar materials or having a similar function, the ability to bounce is the most prominent shared characteristic between the two objects.",
    "13936": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: According to the Punnett square, there are four possible combinations of alleles for the flower form trait in the offspring: Ff, ff, Ff, and ff. Out of these four combinations, only one combination (ff) results in single flowers. Therefore, the probability that a rose plant produced by this cross will have single flowers is 1 out of 4, or 1/4.",
    "13938": "The answer is B. Loon. \n\nThe loon is a type of waterfowl that belongs to the family Gaviidae. It is characterized by its long neck, large head, and distinctive call. Loons are found in North America and Eurasia, where they inhabit lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. They are known for their ability to dive underwater to catch fish and other aquatic prey. While they may share some physical similarities with other birds, such as having feathers and being warm-blooded, the loon is specifically classified as a bird due to its unique characteristics and behavior.",
    "13940": "The answer is A. \n\nThe slump test that Ann and Kiara conducted is designed to assess the consistency and workability of freshly mixed concrete. By pouring the concrete into an upside-down metal cone and observing whether it maintains its shape after being lifted, they can determine if the concrete is firm enough to be used in their construction project. If the concrete collapses, it indicates that the batch may not meet the required standards for firmness and workability, and thus should not be used. Therefore, the slump test can show if a new batch of concrete is firm enough to use. Option B is incorrect because the slump test does not measure the drying time of the concrete; it only evaluates the consistency and workability of the freshly mixed concrete.",
    "13942": "The answer is A. \n\nThe Kermadec Arc is a deep-sea ecosystem located in the southern Pacific Ocean. This means that it is situated at great depths where there is very little sunlight penetration, making it a dark environment. Therefore, option B can be eliminated as it mentions \"bright sunlight,\" which does not apply to the Kermadec Arc.\n\nIn terms of organisms, the Kermadec Arc is home to various deep-sea creatures such as fish, crustaceans, and other marine life adapted to the low-light conditions. Some of these organisms may have adaptations that allow them to crawl or stick to the rocky surfaces of the seafloor, such as certain types of crabs or sea cucumbers. Thus, option A better describes the Kermadec Arc ecosystem by mentioning both the presence of water at the bottom of the ocean and organisms that crawl or stick to the ground.",

This reduction in production capacity will likely lead to a decrease in the overall supply of cough drops available in the market.",
    "14021": "The answer is B. Ad Hominem: An attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. \n\nIn this case, the speaker is attacking their opponent by pointing out their own habits and lifestyle choices instead of addressing the actual merits or flaws of the budget proposal. This is an example of an ad hominem fallacy because it diverts attention away from the argument being made to the personal characteristics of the person making the argument.",
    "14027": "The answer is A: three-toed sloth. \n\nThree-toed sloths are mammals, which are a type of vertebrate. The other options\u2014bess beetle, praying mantis, and pipevine swallowtail butterfly\u2014are insects or arthropods, which are invertebrates.",

    "14078": "The answer is A. common marmoset.\n\nThe common marmoset is a small primate native to South America that is known for its ability to climb trees. It has long, curved claws on its fingers and toes that help it grip branches and move through the treetops. This adaptation allows the common marmoset to find food and shelter in the canopy of the forest, as well as to escape predators by quickly moving up into the trees. In contrast, the Grevy's zebra is a large equine species that is adapted for living in open grasslands and savannas, where it can run quickly to escape predators. Its hooves are broad and flat, which helps it to distribute its weight evenly across the ground and to run at high speeds. Therefore, the common marmoset is the correct answer to the question.\n",

Based on the context provided, the beak of the Bronzy Sunbird is adapted to get nectar out of long flowers. Therefore, it can be inferred that the green violetear, another bird mentioned in the options, would also have a similar adaptation for getting nectar out of long flowers, as it belongs to the same family as the Bronzy Sunbird - the Nectariniidae family. The Northern Mockingbird, on the other hand, is not known for having a beak adapted for extracting nectar from long flowers.",
    "14115": "The answer is A - acquired. \n\nMost scars are caused by accidents during a person's life, so Jenna's scar on her right leg is likely an acquired trait due to an injury or accident that occurred in her life. Inherited traits are passed down through genes from parents to offspring, while acquired traits result from environmental factors or experiences. Since scars are typically the result of external events rather than genetic inheritance, it is reasonable to conclude that Jenna's scar is an acquired trait.",
    "14123": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Quincy's parents had straight hair, which implies they likely carried the genes responsible for straight hair. Since they passed these genes to Quincy, it supports the conclusion that Quincy inherited the straight hair trait from them. Option B does not provide any information about the genetic inheritance of the hair type, so it cannot support the conclusion that Quincy inherited the trait.",

    "14225": "The answer is (B) giant pangolin. \n\nThe giant pangolin is known for its unique defense mechanism, which involves rolling up into a tight ball when threatened or attacked by predators. This behavior is facilitated by the pangolin's tough, scaly skin that covers most of its body, providing an effective barrier against sharp teeth and claws. Additionally, the pangolin's small size and speed make it difficult for predators to catch and consume them. In contrast, the hyrax does not have such adaptations for protection against predators with sharp teeth.",
    "14228": "The answer is B.\n\nThe passage describes the weather in Death Valley, as it mentions a specific event that occurred on a particular date - a record high temperature of 134\u00b0F being recorded on July 10, 1913. This is an example of a short-term atmospheric condition, which falls under the definition of weather. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a certain area, such as average temperatures and precipitation levels over a period of time. Since the passage only provides information about a single instance of extreme heat, it does not provide enough data to determine the overall climate of Death Valley. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as the passage describes the weather rather than the climate.",

They form the base of the food web and are typically plants or algae. In this case, the bear sedge is a plant that can produce its own food through photosynthesis, making it the producer in this food web. The brown lemming and mushroom are consumers, as they rely on other organisms for their food.",
    "14247": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nStretching a rubber band involves a change in shape without altering its chemical composition, making it a physical change. Similarly, an iceberg melting slowly involves a change in state from solid to liquid, but the chemical makeup of the ice remains unchanged, thus also being a physical change. Neither process involves the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, which would be necessary for a chemical change to occur.",

If the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C, then Darnel's test would show that the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C. This test was designed to simulate unusually warm weather conditions, so if the weather station performed well under these conditions, it would indicate that it would also perform well in other warm weather situations. On the other hand, option A is incorrect because the test chamber did not have any wind, so it cannot demonstrate how well the weather station would work when it was windy.",
    "14265": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B provides evidence that Rosa inherited the trait of naturally black hair because it suggests that both of her biological parents possess the same trait, indicating a genetic basis for the hair color.

The forces acting on Kinsley are unbalanced because the seat of the cart is pushing up on her with a force of 1,200N while Earth's gravity is pulling down on her with a force of 600N. Since these forces are in opposite directions and one is greater than the other, they do not cancel each other out, resulting in an unbalanced force. This means that there is a net force on Kinsley, causing her to accelerate upwards along with the roller coaster cart.",
    "14281": "The answer is B. Hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations. \n\nIn this case, Mr. McClure is making a broad statement about all literature classes being boring based on his own experience in one class. This is an example of a hasty generalization because he is making a sweeping conclusion about a large group of things (all literature classes) based on a single observation (his own class). It is important to remember that just because something happened once or in one instance does not mean it will always be true or that it applies to everyone or everything.",

These conditions make it difficult for large plants to grow, so the ecosystem is dominated by small plants such as grasses, mosses, and lichens. Additionally, the high altitude of the plateau means that there is less oxygen available, which can also limit plant growth. Therefore, option A is the correct description of the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem. Option B is incorrect because tundra ecosystems typically have cold temperatures year-round, rather than warm summers and cool winters.",
    "14334": "The answer is A. \n\nThis is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"the Guadalupe Mountains National Park\") and a predicate (\"offers one of the finest examples of an ancient marine reef\"). It expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.",
    "14337": "The answer is A. \n\nWith the given supplies, Lauren can investigate whether milk chocolate or dark chocolate melts faster when heated on the stove. This is because she has one bar of milk chocolate and one bar of dark chocolate, as well as a stove and a pot. She can set up an experiment where she heats both types of chocolate on the stove simultaneously and observe which one melts faster. This will allow her to determine if there is a difference in melting rates between the two types of chocolate. \n\nShe cannot investigate option B because she does not have any white chocolate. Option C is also not possible since she does not have a microwave available.",
    "14339": "The answer is A. Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles because it contains more solute particles in the same volume of solvent compared to Solution B.",
    "14350": "The answer is A.\n\nJuan's experiment involves setting up five pairs of platform bird feeders, filling one feeder in each pair with sunflower seeds and the other feeder with flax seeds. He then observed the cardinals' visits to these feeders during the same hour each morning and recorded the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with sunflower seeds and the number of visits to feeders with flax seeds. This setup allows Juan to compare the frequency of visits by cardinals to feeders containing sunflower seeds versus those containing flax seeds. Therefore, the question that Juan's experiment can best answer is whether cardinals visit feeders containing sunflower seeds more often than feeders containing flax seeds. Option B is not directly addressed by Juan's experiment as it focuses on the quantity of seeds consumed per visit rather than the frequency of visits.",
    "14359": "The answer is B. \n\nThe passage describes the climate because it refers to the pattern of weather in a certain place, specifically mentioning that winter is the rainiest season of the year. This statement provides information about the typical weather conditions in Cole's location during the winter season, which is characteristic of climate rather than a specific instance of weather.",
    "14363": "The answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, both Solution A and Solution B have the same volume of solvent (35 mL). However, the number of purple particles in each solution is different. Solution A contains 6 purple particles, while Solution B contains 4 purple particles. Since the volume of the solvent is the same for both solutions, the concentration of the solute can be determined by comparing the number of solute particles to the volume of the solvent. In this case, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles because it has more solute particles per unit volume compared to Solution B. Therefore, the correct answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.",
    "14366": "The answer is A. It makes its own food.\n\nIn a food chain, producers are organisms that can produce their own food through photosynthesis. They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create energy-rich molecules like glucose, which they use for growth and reproduction. Producers form the base of the food chain and provide energy for other organisms in the ecosystem. In this case, the cotton bush is a producer because it can make its own food through photosynthesis.",

    "14451": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of each sample, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its average speed.\n\nFor Sample A:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_A \\)) = 36 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_A \\)) = 1,600 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2}m_Av_A^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(36 \\text{ u})(1,600 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_B \\)) = 16 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_B \\)) = 1,500 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2}m_Bv_B^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(16 \\text{ u})(1,500 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\]\n\nNow, let's compare the average kinetic energies:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2}(36)(1,600)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2}(16)(1,500)^2 \\]\n\nSince the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, but the average speed of the particles in Sample A is also greater, it is difficult to determine the exact values without performing the calculations. However, based on the given information, we can infer that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher than that in Sample B because both the mass and the speed of the particles contribute to the average kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, Sample A has the higher temperature compared to Sample B.",

Ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis, are attached to the rough ER or float freely within the cytoplasm. This process is crucial for the production of various proteins needed by the cell. \n\nOption B is incorrect because plant cells, not animal cells, use sunlight to make sugar through photosynthesis, which occurs in chloroplasts. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because plant cells typically contain both a nucleus and chloroplasts, which are organelles involved in photosynthesis. Some plant cells may lack chloroplasts if they are specialized for other functions, such as storage or mechanical support, but this is not a universal characteristic of all plant cells.",
    "14461": "The answer is B. Are eggs more likely to float in fresh water or salty water?\n\nThis is because Rosa's experiment involved comparing the behavior of eggs in both fresh water and salty water. By repeating the process with two more eggs and counting the number of times the eggs floated in each type of water, she was able to determine whether eggs were more likely to float in fresh water or salty water. The other option, (A), is not directly addressed by Rosa's experiment since she did not vary the amount of water in the glasses.",

Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the first and last words on a given page. If \"lest\" were to appear in the dictionary, it would likely be placed between words like \"lens\" and \"level,\" as it starts with the letter 'l' and falls within the same alphabetical section.",
    "14581": "The answer is A. The hyperbole in the text suggests that Edgar was very tired and sore after finishing the marathon, exaggerating his physical state to emphasize how exhausted he felt. The statement \"he could no longer move a single muscle\" is an overstatement used to convey the intensity of his fatigue.",
    "14583": "The answer is C. Sample B has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample A. Since the average particle speed is the same in both samples, the higher mass particles in Sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy, which is directly related to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.",

In this case, we want to give the concept of time human-like qualities. Option A, \"creeps up on you,\" is an example of personification because it attributes the action of \"creeping\" to time, making it seem like time is a living entity that can move silently and unexpectedly. Option B, \"affects everyone,\" does not use personification as it describes time in a more general way without giving it human-like qualities.",
    "14600": "The answer is B. Olympia.",
    "14603": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the size of the magnets affects their magnetic strength. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields than smaller ones. In Pair 1, the magnets are smaller compared to those in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker than that in Pair 2.",

The mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene affected the structure and function of the Fgfr1a1 protein.\n\nIn the passage, it is mentioned that the Fgfr1a1 protein is encoded by the fgfr1a1 gene. When there is a mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene, it results in a different form of the Fgfr1a1 protein with a different structure. This altered protein cannot send signals to the fish's body, leading to the development of large, patchy scales instead of the small, evenly spaced scales found in normal common carp. Therefore, the mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene affects the structure and function of the Fgfr1a1 protein.",
    "16631": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"terribly\" is used to describe the intensity or severity of shivering, which aligns with its traditional sense of being an adverb meaning extremely or very.

Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Sawing a log in half involves cutting through the wood with a saw, which is a physical action that does not alter the chemical composition of the wood. It results in a change in the shape and size of the log but not in its chemical properties.\n- A rock heating up in a campfire involves the transfer of heat energy to the rock, causing it to expand or change shape due to thermal expansion. This is also a physical change as it affects the state or form of the rock without altering its chemical composition.\n\nNeither of these processes involves any chemical reactions where new substances are formed, so they can be classified as physical changes.",
    "16656": "The answer is (B) bronze mannikin.\n\nThe image shows a close-up of a bird with a blue beak, which is likely a Hawfinch based on its appearance. Since the question asks for another bird with a beak adapted to crack hard seeds, we can infer that the bird in the image is a Hawfinch. Therefore, the other bird with a similar adaptation would be the bronze mannikin, as it is known for having a strong beak capable of cracking hard seeds. The blue rock pigeon, on the other hand, does not have a beak adapted for cracking hard seeds.\n",

    "17028": "The answer is B.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn this case, both samples have the same mass of each particle (46 u), but the average particle speed in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B (1,500 m/s vs. 1,400 m/s). Since the mass of the particles is the same, the difference in their speeds will result in a difference in their kinetic energies.\n\nThe formula for kinetic energy is:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity (speed).\n\nSince the mass of the particles is the same in both samples, the kinetic energy will be proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore, the sample with the higher average particle speed (Sample A) will have a higher average kinetic energy.\n\nAs a result, Sample A has the higher temperature because it has the higher average kinetic energy of its particles compared to Sample B.",

    "18186": "The answer is B.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of the particles. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can focus on comparing their masses and speeds.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average particle speed is 1,300 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 44 u and the average particle speed is 1,200 m/s.\n\nComparing the kinetic energies:\n- For Sample A: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 = 0.5 * 46 u * (1,300 m/s)^2\n- For Sample B: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 = 0.5 * 44 u * (1,200 m/s)^2\n\nSince the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, and the average particle speed in Sample A is also greater than the average particle speed in Sample B, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A will be higher than that in Sample B.\n\nAs temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles, Sample A has the higher temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

This choice implies that he values the fun and activities in the Theater Club more than those in the Photography Club, but it also means he misses out on the fun and experiences associated with the Photography Club.",
    "18721": "The answer is B. mineral.\n\nGraphite is a mineral because it is a naturally occurring solid with a fixed chemical composition and crystalline structure. It is composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, which gives it its characteristic dark gray color and slippery feel. While graphite can be found in nature, it is not considered a rock because rocks are aggregates of one or more minerals, and they are formed through geological processes. Graphite is a single mineral, and it is not formed through any geological process, but rather through the metamorphism of other carbon-rich materials such as coal.",

In this case, we want to use personification to describe how the painting draws people in. Option B, \"attracted,\" is more appropriate because it implies that the painting has qualities that make it appealing or interesting to visitors, as if it were alive and engaging them. Option A, \"screamed for,\" is less suitable because it suggests a more aggressive or unpleasant reaction, which doesn't fit the context of a painting attracting visitors.",
    "19174": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all the offspring have the genotype ee, which means they will have red eyes because the allele e is recessive. Therefore, there are no offspring with brown eyes in this cross. The expected ratio of offspring with red eyes to offspring with brown eyes is 4:0.",
    "19181": "The answer is A. Ardea alba.\n\nExplanation: The great blue heron belongs to the genus \"Ardea,\" so we need to find another organism that also belongs to the same genus. Option A, Ardea alba, is the only option that shares the same genus with the great blue heron. Option B, Ictinia mississippiensis, belongs to the genus \"Ictinia,\" and option C, Phoebastria nigripes, belongs to the genus \"Phoebastria.\" Therefore, the correct answer is A. Ardea alba.",

Therefore, option A provides a more accurate and realistic estimate for the volume of a can of soda pop.",
    "19233": "The answer is C. 4 pounds. \n\nThis is because a typical skateboard usually weighs around 4 pounds or less, depending on its size and materials used in construction. An ounce is much lighter than a pound, so option A is too light. On the other hand, a ton is an extremely heavy unit of measurement, equivalent to 2,000 pounds, making option B far too heavy for a skateboard. Therefore, option C is the most accurate estimate for the mass of a skateboard.",
    "19234": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the information provided, Bandit has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene, where F represents the allele for black fur. Since the allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f), Bandit will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which in this case is black fur. Therefore, Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait is black fur.",
    "19235": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Bending a paper clip involves changing its shape without altering its chemical composition or properties. This is a physical change because no new substance is formed, and the material remains the same.\n- Ice melting in a glass involves the transition of ice from a solid state to a liquid state due to an increase in temperature. This is also a physical change as it does not involve any chemical reaction; instead, it is a phase change where the water molecules rearrange themselves into a liquid form.\n\nBoth actions described do not result in the formation of new substances, thus they are classified as physical changes.",
    "19238": "The answer is B. soft. \n\nFeathers are typically soft and lightweight, allowing birds to fly efficiently.

    "19285": "The answer is A. polar bear.\n\nThe image shows a snow leopard, which is an animal that lives in cold, snowy mountains of Central Asia. Its fur is adapted to help it survive in these cold environments. However, the question asks for another animal whose skin is adapted for survival in cold places. Among the given options, the polar bear is the correct answer as its thick layer of fat and dense fur coat helps it to stay warm in extremely cold temperatures, similar to how the snow leopard's fur helps it survive in its habitat. The naked mole rat, on the other hand, is adapted to live in hot and dry environments, with a unique skin structure that allows it to thrive in such conditions.\n",
    "19294": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"terribly\" is used to describe the intensity or severity of Aiden's shivering, which aligns with its traditional sense of being an adverb meaning extremely or very. Option A uses \"terribly\" to modify the adjective \"steep,\" which is not its traditional usage.",

This could involve spending time and money to acquire or make the costume, which would be a cost in terms of resources and effort. Option A suggests that Maria will get to wear the costume she is more excited about, but since she already has a superhero costume, this option does not pertain to the scenario where she decides to go as a ghost.",
    "19299": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Bending a paper clip involves changing its shape without altering its chemical composition or structure. This is a physical change because no new substance is formed, and the properties of the paper clip remain the same except for its shape.\n- Cracking open a peanut also involves a physical change. When you crack a peanut, you are breaking it into smaller pieces, but the chemical composition of the peanut remains unchanged. The peanut is still a peanut, just broken into smaller parts.\n\nNeither bending a paper clip nor cracking a peanut results in the formation of a new substance, so they are both classified as physical changes. Neither process involves heating or cooling, nor does either involve a chemical reaction that would result in a different type of matter being produced. Therefore, options A, C, and D can be eliminated.",

If Rick's biological father has curly hair, it suggests that Rick may have inherited the gene responsible for curly hair from him. This is because traits like hair texture are often determined by genetic factors, and if one parent has a specific trait, there is a higher likelihood that their offspring will inherit that trait as well. However, it's important to note that other factors such as environmental influences or random genetic mutations can also play a role in determining hair texture."
