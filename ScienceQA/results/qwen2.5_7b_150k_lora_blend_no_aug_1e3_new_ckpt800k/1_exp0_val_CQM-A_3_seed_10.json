    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\" Jackhammers are known for being extremely loud, so the phrase implies that Mr. Herrera's snoring is quite noisy.",
    "7": "The answer is B. armored catfish. \n\nIn the image, we can see that the sturgeon has a mouth located on the underside of its head and points downward, which is an adaptation for bottom feeding. Similarly, the armored catfish also has a mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is a bottom-dwelling fish that feeds on the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. The discus, on the other hand, is a freshwater fish that typically lives in the upper layers of water and does not have a mouth adapted for bottom feeding.",
    "8": "The answer is A. \n\nThe given statement is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"to create\"), making it a complete thought or independent clause. It describes an action that occurred during the construction of Mount Rushmore, providing context and additional information about the process. To make it a sentence fragment, it would need to be combined with another independent clause or a dependent clause to form a complete sentence.",
    "13": "The answer is C. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n\nWendy's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This experiment aimed to determine if increasing the nutrient supply to the bacteria would result in a 20% increase in insulin production. By comparing the insulin production levels between the two groups of bacteria, Wendy could assess whether her intervention was effective in achieving the desired outcome. Therefore, the test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. Options A and B are not directly related to the specific goal of Wendy's experiment, which was to increase insulin production by 20%.",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title format for a play, as it follows standard capitalization rules for titles, with each significant word capitalized.",
    "16": "The answer is B.",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns. \n\nSince Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, she has two copies of the dominant allele H. According to the context provided, the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). Therefore, Daffodil will express the dominant trait, which is not having horns. However, since the allele for having horns (h) is recessive, it would be expressed only if both alleles were h, which they are not in Daffodil's case. Thus, her phenotype for the horns trait is having horns.",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon. \n\nWhile both the bald eagle and the New Zealand falcon have strong, sharp talons that are adapted for grabbing and holding onto prey, the New Zealand falcon is known to be an excellent predator, often hunting small birds and insects in flight. Its feet are specifically adapted for grasping and manipulating its prey, allowing it to catch and hold onto its food with precision. The sable, on the other hand, is a type of weasel and does not have feet adapted for grabbing prey; instead, it uses its teeth and claws to hunt and capture its prey.",
    "36": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Mars. \n\nFrom the table, we can see that:\n- Jupiter's volume is approximately \\( 1.43 \\times 10^{15} \\) km\u00b3\n- Mars' volume is approximately \\( 1.63 \\times 10^{11} \\) km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Jupiter's volume is compared to Mars':\n\\( \\frac{1.43 \\times 10^{15}}{1.63 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx 8.79 \\times 10^3 \\)\n\nThis means that Jupiter's volume is approximately 8,790 times larger than Mars'. Since 8,790 is greater than 10,000, the statement \"Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars\" is true.",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we can say that the raindrops \"kissed\" the fans' cheeks, giving them a more lively and expressive description compared to simply saying they \"landed on\" the fans' cheeks.",
    "52": "The answer is C. \n\nEarthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.",
    "55": "The answer is A. Yes, Lithops bromfieldii is made up of many cells. As it is a plant, it belongs to the kingdom Plantae, which consists of multicellular organisms. Plants are composed of various types of cells that work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems, allowing them to perform essential functions such as photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction. In the case of Lithops bromfieldii, each leaf is made up of many cells, and the entire plant is composed of numerous cells working together to sustain life and carry out its functions.",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture. \n\nCape vultures are known for their hooked beaks, which are specifically adapted to tear through meat. This adaptation allows them to efficiently consume carrion, which forms a significant part of their diet. Sand martins, on the other hand, have a different type of beak that is more suited for catching insects in flight, making option A incorrect.",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" is said while observing an ancient pug that seems to sleep all day. This implies that the speaker is using irony to express that the pug is not energetic at all, despite the literal meaning of the phrase.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"the prodigal son returned home\" comes from the Bible, specifically from the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15:11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 30 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 114 to 228 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as it aligns with the typical capacity of a car's gas tank.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho. According to the map, Idaho is located in the northern part of the United States, while Alabama, South Carolina, and Oklahoma are situated further south.",
    "74": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option provides specific context about where and how Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, indicating that it was learned rather than an innate or inherited trait. Option A only states that Austen can cook food over a fire, which does not necessarily imply that she learned how to build a fire; it could be something she already knew how to do. Therefore, option B offers more evidence supporting the conclusion that Austen acquired the trait of building a fire.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft. \n\nAll three objects - soccer shorts, jello, and an apron - can be considered soft or flexible to some degree. Soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a gelatinous substance that is soft and pliable, and an apron is typically made of soft, lightweight material like cotton or polyester. None of these objects are bouncy or hard.",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.",
    "81": "The answer is B.",
    "82": "The answer is B. sturgeon. \n\nSturgeons are bottom feeders that have mouths adapted to filter food from the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Their mouths are typically located on the underside of their heads and point downward, similar to the armored catfish mentioned in the context. This adaptation allows them to effectively gather food particles from the bottom substrate as they move along the riverbed or lakebed. On the other hand, clown triggerfish are not bottom feeders and primarily consume algae and small invertebrates found on coral reefs.",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 41\u00b0C is equivalent to approximately 106\u00b0F, which would be considered very hot rather than cold. On a cold, rainy day, temperatures are typically much lower, closer to the Fahrenheit scale where 41\u00b0F is a more reasonable estimate for such conditions.",
    "101": "The answer is B. Sour. Both limes and dill pickles are known for their sour taste.",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is a producer as it is not being consumed by any other organism in the food web.",
    "113": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: \n  Distance = 555 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 555 km / 10 hours = 55.5 km/h\n\n- For option B:\n  Distance = 95 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 95 km / 10 hours = 9.5 km/h\n\n- For option C:\n  Distance = 460 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 460 km / 10 hours = 46 km/h\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Option A: 55.5 km/h\n- Option B: 9.5 km/h\n- Option C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is the one in option B, which moved 95 kilometers south in 10 hours, with a speed of 9.5 km/h.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur.\" This is because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in a heterozygous genotype (Ff). However, since the allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f), Sasha will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which is short fur.",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. In this case, each part of the sentence expresses a complete thought:\n- \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud\" (independent clause)\n- \"we gave him a bath\" (independent clause)\n\nOption A, \"Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes,\" is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause. It does not have any conjunctions joining two or more independent clauses together.",
    "124": "The answer is C. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all the offspring have the genotype ee, which means they will have black eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0.",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Rosa's father has brown eyes, indicating that he likely passed the trait of having brown eyes to Rosa through genetic inheritance. This is a common way in which traits are inherited from parents to offspring. Option A does not provide any direct evidence of genetic inheritance but rather a correlation between Rosa's eye color and her hair color, which is not necessarily related to the inheritance of the eye color trait.",
    "148": "The answer is A.",
    "150": "The answer is B.",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, thereby attempting to undermine Richard's credibility or suitability for the position of class treasurer.",
    "160": "The answer is B.",
    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction where the acid in the vinegar reacts with the copper oxide on the surface of the penny, converting it back to copper, thus removing the tarnish. This process changes the composition of the substance, making it a chemical change.",
    "165": "The answer is B.",
    "169": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range.

This phrase is often used to describe someone who can turn their hand to anything they put their mind to and achieve great success.",
    "178": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and one subordinate idea (the source of the information).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence. It has an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"Although presidential elections take place in early November\").\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which is a complex sentence, both options A and B qualify as complex sentences based on their structure. If you need to choose only one, either option would be correct.",
    "206": "The answer is B. True.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Mars and Mercury. According to the table:\n\n- Volume of Mars = 160 billion km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mercury = 60 billion km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Mars' volume is compared to Mercury's:\n\nMars' volume / Mercury's volume = 160 billion km\u00b3 / 60 billion km\u00b3 \u2248 2.67\n\nSince 2.67 is less than 3, the statement \"The volume of Mars is more than three times as large as Mercury's\" is false. Therefore, the correct answer is A. False.",

    "231": "The answer is B. Noah was upset about staying home. Verbal irony occurs when someone says something that means the opposite of what they actually mean. In this case, Noah is saying that it was \"good luck\" to have to study for a test, but the implication is that he would rather be at the water park with his friends. This suggests that Noah is actually upset or frustrated about being stuck studying instead of enjoying the water park with his friends.",
    "240": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Cooking a pancake involves the chemical reaction between the ingredients, such as flour, eggs, and milk, to form a new substance (the pancake batter). When the batter is cooked, it undergoes a chemical change that results in the formation of gluten and other proteins, giving the pancake its texture and structure.\n- Rusting on a bicycle frame is also a chemical process. It occurs when iron or steel in the frame reacts with oxygen and water in the air, leading to the formation of iron oxide (rust). This reaction is a chemical change because it involves the transformation of one substance into another.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions rather than just physical changes, making option D the correct choice.",

    "302": "The answer is B. \n\nIn thermodynamics, thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles in the object possess, resulting in more thermal energy. Therefore, among the three options provided, the bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 22\u00b0C will have the least thermal energy because it has the lowest temperature compared to the other two options.",
    "309": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the average particle speed is 1,200 m/s, while in Sample B, the average particle speed is 1,000 m/s. Since the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the difference in their average particle speeds indicates that the particles in Sample A have more kinetic energy than those in Sample B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, Sample A has the higher temperature because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy.",
    "317": "The answer is A.\n\nThe passage describes the weather because it talks about specific events that occur in Oklahoma, such as large thunderstorms and violent storms during the summer months. These are short-term atmospheric conditions that can change quickly and are therefore considered weather.

    "656": "The answer is A.",
    "661": "The answer is B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie. \n\nThis is because the seat of the cart is pushing up on Kylie with a force of 1,200N, while Earth's gravity is pulling down on her with a force of 600N. Since these forces are in opposite directions, they are not balanced. Therefore, there is a net force acting on Kylie, causing her to accelerate upwards due to the greater upward force exerted by the seat compared to the downward force of gravity.",
    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.",
    "664": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since the strength of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets and the orientation of their poles, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs as long as the distance between the magnets remains constant. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

Skin color is influenced by multiple genes, and people with darker skin tones often have more melanin in their skin, which is produced by cells called melanocytes. This trait is usually present from birth and is not something that can be changed through environmental factors alone.",
    "722": "The answer is A. \n\nLeather belts typically range in length from around 80 to 120 centimeters (31 to 47 inches), depending on the size of the person wearing it. Therefore, option A (75 centimeters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option B (75 meters), as 75 meters would be an extremely long belt that is not practical or common for most people.",
    "724": "The answer is B. Both are caused by heating.\n\nIn both melting glass and cooking an egg, heat is used to cause a change in the state or properties of the substance. Melting glass involves heating it until it becomes liquid, while cooking an egg involves heating it until it changes from a liquid to a solid state. These processes involve changes that can be reversed if the heat is removed, indicating they are physical changes rather than chemical ones. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.",

    "2282": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and their size. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have the same magnetic strength per unit volume. Therefore, the larger the magnet, the stronger its magnetic field will be. In Pair 1, the magnets are smaller than those in Pair 2, so the magnetic force between them will be weaker. In Pair 2, the magnets are larger, so the magnetic force between them will be stronger. However, since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same in both pairs.",
    "2290": "The answer is B. Connecticut.",
    "2295": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim. \n\nThis is because the forces acting on Hakim are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (400N downward due to gravity and 400N upward from the diving board). When these forces are equal and opposite, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. This means that Hakim is in equilibrium and will remain stationary unless another force acts upon him.",

    "2311": "The answer is A. A school bus carrying 600 pounds would need a larger force to come to a stop compared to a school bus carrying 500 pounds, assuming both buses have the same stopping distance and deceleration rate. This is because the heavier bus has more mass, and according to Newton's second law of motion (F=ma), a greater force is required to accelerate or decelerate an object with more mass. Therefore, the bus with the higher weight (600 pounds) will require a larger force to bring it to a stop compared to the bus with the lower weight (500 pounds).",

    "2657": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of the gases, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its average speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (1,600 m/s). However, the masses of the particles differ:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 40 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 26 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies directly using the masses:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the speeds are the same, the kinetic energy will be proportional to the mass. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B because the mass of the particles in Sample A is larger.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher, the temperature of Sample A is also higher than that of Sample B. Thus, the correct answer is (C) sample A.",

This seasonal pattern affects the vegetation and wildlife in the region, as plants grow and animals migrate in response to the changing weather conditions.\n\nIn addition to the seasonal rainfall patterns, the soil in the Serengeti National Park is generally poor in nutrients. This is due to the type of vegetation found in the area, which consists mainly of grasses and shrubs. These plants have shallow root systems and do not contribute much organic matter to the soil through their decomposition. As a result, the soil in the Serengeti National Park tends to be nutrient-poor, which can limit the growth of certain plant species and affect the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, option B, \"It has a rainy season and a dry season. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients,\" better describes the Serengeti National Park ecosystem.",

False dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist. \n\nIn Dave's statement, he is presenting only two choices (voting for the Conservative Party or voting for the Labour Party), but there could be other political parties or voting methods available. This limits the options and creates a false dichotomy.",
    "6063": "The answer is A. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms to create a paradoxical effect. In this case, \"open secret\" is an oxymoron because \"open\" implies something that is known by many people, while \"secret\" implies something that is kept hidden. The phrase suggests that although Emilio's friends know he is writing a book, he himself does not talk about it, creating a paradoxical situation where the information is both known and unknown simultaneously.",

    "6080": "The answer is A. Malayan colugo. \n\nMalayan colugos, also known as flying lemurs or flying squirrels, are arboreal mammals native to Southeast Asia. They possess a unique adaptation that allows them to glide through the air using a membrane of skin that stretches between their limbs. This membrane, called a patagium, is similar to the one found in sugar gliders, allowing them to glide from tree to tree with remarkable agility and speed. The Sumatran orangutan, on the other hand, is an arboreal primate that primarily uses its long arms to swing from branch to branch in search of food and shelter, but it does not have any adaptations for gliding like the Malayan colugo.",

During the wet season, the area receives heavy rainfall, while during the dry season, there is little to no precipitation. This seasonal variation in rainfall affects the vegetation and soil conditions in the region. The soil in the Gran Sabana is generally poor in nutrients due to the leaching effect caused by the heavy rainfall during the wet season. Therefore, option B better describes the Gran Sabana ecosystem. Option A is incorrect because the Gran Sabana does not experience year-round rain; instead, it has a distinct wet and dry season.",

Additionally, it helps maintain the internal environment of the cell by regulating the concentration of ions and other molecules within the cell. This function is crucial for the survival and proper functioning of the cell.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the nucleus of a plant cell does have chromosomes. The nucleus contains the genetic material of the cell, which is organized into chromosomes. These chromosomes carry the genetic information necessary for the development and function of the plant cell.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because mitochondria do not directly send instructions to different parts of a plant cell. Instead, they play a role in cellular respiration, producing energy in the form of ATP. The instructions for cell activities are carried out by the cell's DNA, which is located in the nucleus. The mitochondria then use these instructions to produce energy, which is essential for the overall function of the cell.",

Euphemism.\n\nIn this context, \"old news\" is being used as a euphemism to soften or avoid directly stating that Mark's leaving his job is something that has already happened and is no longer newsworthy. Euphemisms are words or phrases that are used instead of potentially offensive, harsh, or blunt terms. They are often employed to make a statement more polite or less direct. In this case, saying \"old news\" instead of explicitly stating that Mark has already left his job avoids the directness of the action and makes it sound like it was planned well in advance, thus softening the impact of the statement.",
    "9748": "The answer is B. \n\nThe given sentence is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"The Zion Narrows\") and a predicate (\"stretching for sixteen miles and, in some areas, narrowing to just twenty feet\"). It is a complete thought that expresses a full idea, making it a complete sentence rather than a fragment.",
    "9752": "The answer is C. New Hampshire.",
    "9755": "The answer is C. Logos (reason).\n\nThe advertisement appeals to reason by presenting evidence-based claims that the Vilaplus vacuum cleaner outperforms other brands in laboratory tests.

Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn both cases, heat is used to cook or bake the food items:\n- For baking an apple pie, the oven heats up the pie, causing the dough to rise and the filling to cook.\n- For cooking an egg, the heat from a pan or stove causes the egg white to coagulate and the yolk to set, resulting in a cooked egg.\n\nNeither of these processes involves cooling as a primary cause; rather, they rely on heating to achieve the desired outcome. Additionally, while both can be considered chemical reactions (as cooking eggs involves denaturing proteins), they are primarily classified as physical changes due to the transformation of the food items' textures and states without altering their fundamental composition.",
    "9910": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets and their size and shape. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have the same magnetic strength. Therefore, the size and shape of the magnets will determine the magnitude of the magnetic force. In Pair 1, the magnets are larger than those in Pair 2, so the magnetic force between them should be greater. However, since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs.",

    "10213": "The answer is A. No.\n\nMegaptera novaeangliae, also known as the humpback whale, is an aquatic mammal that belongs to the animal kingdom. As a member of the animal kingdom, humpback whales are heterotrophs, meaning they cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis or other means. Instead, they must consume other organisms to obtain the energy and nutrients they need to survive. Humpback whales primarily feed on small fish and krill, which they catch by filtering water through their baleen plates.",
    "10227": "The answer is B. The statement \"Neil, you didn't vote in the last election, so you clearly have no regard for the democracy in which we live\" uses a false dichotomy because it presents only two choices: either Neil voted or he doesn't care about democracy. This ignores other possible reasons why Neil might not have voted, such as being unable to vote due to a disability, not being registered to vote, or simply not being interested in the election. The argument oversimplifies the situation by reducing it to just two extremes without considering other possibilities.",

Arctic wolf. \n\nArctic wolves are well-adapted to living in cold, snowy environments due to their thick fur coat that provides insulation against the harsh winter conditions. Their white fur coloration helps them blend into the snowy landscape, making it easier for them to hunt and avoid predators. This adaptation is crucial for their survival in the Arctic tundra, where they rely on camouflage to stay hidden while hunting for food or to avoid being spotted by other animals. In contrast, the porcupine does not have any specific adaptations for camouflage in the snow, as its quills are primarily used for defense rather than blending into the environment.",
    "10383": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Neptune and Earth. According to the table, Neptune's volume is 62,530 billion km\u00b3, while Earth's volume is 1,090 billion km\u00b3. To find out how many times greater Neptune's volume is compared to Earth's, we can divide Neptune's volume by Earth's volume:\n\n62,530 / 1,090 \u2248 57.4\n\nSince 57.4 is more than 50, the statement \"Neptune's volume is more than 50 times as great as that of Earth\" is true.",

    "11289": "The answer is B. The phrase \"turn the other cheek\" is an allusion to the biblical passage found in Matthew 5:39, where Jesus says, \"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek also.\" This allusion suggests that Major, as a cow with the homozygous genotype HH for the horns trait, will exhibit the phenotype of not having horns because the allele H (for not having horns) is dominant over the allele h (for having horns). Therefore, since Major has two copies of the dominant allele H, he will express the dominant trait, which is not having horns. \n\nFor the second context, the correct greeting for a letter is option A: \"Dear Mrs. Erickson,\". This is because formal letters typically use the full name and title of the recipient, and the title should be capitalized.\n\nIn the third context, based on the timeline provided, statement B is true: Hinduism began about 1,500 years before Christianity. This can be inferred by comparing the approximate dates of the beginning of Hinduism and Christianity on the timeline.\n\nFinally, for the last context, the source of the allusion in the sentence \"Much to our shock, Tyrone chose to turn the other cheek when Ruth insulted him in a meeting\" is the Bible.

    "11334": "The answer is (B) blowfish. \n\nBlowfish have a unique defense mechanism that involves inflating their body with water or air, making them appear larger and more intimidating to potential predators. Additionally, they have a layer of mucus on their skin that can be toxic to predators if ingested. This combination of physical size and chemical defense makes the blowfish well-adapted to deter attacks from predators. \n\nIn contrast, the fantastic leaf-tailed gecko has a camouflage pattern that allows it to blend in with its surroundings, making it less visible to predators. While this adaptation helps the gecko avoid detection, it does not provide a direct defense against attacks once a predator has identified it. Therefore, the blowfish is better adapted to hurt an attacking predator compared to the fantastic leaf-tailed gecko.",

    "11779": "The answer is B. Ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. \n\nIn this case, the statement \"How could Hazel have anything insightful to say about foreign affairs? She grew up on a farm.\" is an ad hominem fallacy because it attacks the person (Hazel) instead of addressing the actual argument or evidence presented by her regarding foreign affairs. It assumes that because Hazel grew up on a farm, she cannot provide valuable insights into foreign affairs, which is not necessarily true and does not address the quality of her arguments or knowledge on the topic.",
    "11786": "The answer is D. 17 millimeters. \n\nCaterpillars typically range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters, so 17 millimeters would be a reasonable estimate for the length of a caterpillar. 17 centimeters, 17 meters, and 17 kilometers are much too large for a caterpillar.",

She can throw both small and large flat rocks across the river and count the number of skips each rock makes. This will allow her to compare the skipping behavior of small versus large rocks. \n\nShe cannot investigate options A or B because she does not have access to a pond or round rocks in her supplies.",
    "12027": "The answer is B. The cup of black tea with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature. This is because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the thermal energy, the higher the temperature. Therefore, if one cup has less thermal energy than the other, it must also have a lower temperature.",
    "12028": "The answer is C. The sentence \"Mr. Cho signed his name on the letter\" uses the past tense because it describes an action that was completed in the past. The verb \"signed\" indicates that the action happened at a specific time in the past.",
    "12030": "The answer is A. Having horns. \n\nSince Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh, she has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h). Because the allele for having horns (h) is recessive, it will only be expressed if both alleles are recessive (hh). Since Zelda has one dominant allele, she will express the dominant trait, which in this case is having horns. Therefore, her phenotype for the horns trait would be having horns.",

    "14184": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this scenario, both objects are identical in mass and material, but they differ in temperature. The object with the higher temperature (75\u00b0C) will have more thermal energy than the one with the lower temperature (60\u00b0C). This is because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; as the temperature increases, so does the kinetic energy of the particles within the object, resulting in more thermal energy. Therefore, the 100-gram mug of cider at 75\u00b0C has more thermal energy compared to the one at 60\u00b0C.",

    "16220": "The answer is A. \n\nThe statement \"Henry's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes\" suggests that Henry may have inherited the trait of having hazel eyes from his father, as the trait could be influenced by genetic factors passed down through the family lineage. However, it is important to note that eye color can also be influenced by environmental factors such as wearing contacts or other external factors, so this alone does not definitively prove that Henry inherited the trait from his father. Additional information would be needed to confirm the inheritance pattern.",

This experiment would allow her to compare the skipping behavior of different rock sizes under similar conditions, such as the same type of rock surface and throwing technique. \n\nShe cannot investigate options A or C because:\n- Option A requires round rocks, which are not among the supplies.\n- Option C requires a comparison between a river and a pond, which are not both accessible within the given supplies.",
    "16975": "The answer is B. The passage describes the weather because it refers to specific conditions that occurred during a particular time period (over the weekend). Weather involves short-term atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and precipitation, all of which can change rapidly. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term patterns of these conditions in a given area, typically averaged over many years. Since the statement talks about the wind being too weak to fly a kite on a specific day, it is describing a current, short-term condition rather than a long-term pattern. Therefore, it is an example of weather.",
    "16978": "The answer is B. The idiom \"a fish out of water\" suggests that someone feels uncomfortable or out of place in a situation where they are not accustomed to being.

    "18527": "The answer is C: by removing text unrelated to the main idea.\n\nThe student essay contains a mix of general statements and specific examples, but the text is somewhat disorganized. To improve the organization, the writer should focus on removing any text that is not directly related to the main idea of the essay. This will help to make the argument clearer and more focused. For example, the writer could remove the paragraph about summer vacations being started for wealthy families to vacation in the country, as it is not relevant to the main argument about the benefits of year-round schooling. By removing this irrelevant text, the writer can better support their main point with relevant evidence and arguments.",
    "18531": "The answer is C. Among the three options provided, the cookie at a temperature of 13\u00b0C has the highest temperature compared to the other two cookies.

Slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences. \n\nIn the given text, the speaker is making an argument that if they pick up their baby every time he cries, it will lead to extreme consequences where the baby will control the household. This is an example of the slippery slope fallacy, as it assumes that a small action (picking up the baby) will lead to a chain reaction of extreme outcomes (the baby controlling the household).",
    "18566": "The answer is A. \n\nThe image provided shows a black-headed heron, which is an animal that has a long neck that helps it grab fish while keeping the rest of its body still. This adaptation allows the heron to hunt prey more effectively by minimizing movement and scaring off the fish. While the painted stork may also have a long neck, there is no specific information in the context or image to suggest that it has the same adaptation as the black-headed heron. The mallard, on the other hand, is a type of duck that does not have a long neck and is not known for hunting prey in the same way as the black-headed heron. Therefore, option A (painted stork) is the correct answer.",

    "18974": "The answer is D. \n\nTo find out how much time passed between the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and the start of the Civil War in 1861, we need to subtract the year of the Constitutional Convention from the year of the start of the Civil War:\n\n1861 - 1787 = 74 years\n\nSo, 74 years passed between the Constitutional Convention and the start of the Civil War.",
    "18982": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Mixing sand and water: This is a physical change because no new substance is formed; it simply involves combining two different materials without altering their fundamental properties.\n- A rock heating up in a campfire: This is also a physical change as well. Heating the rock does not cause any chemical reaction that would result in a new substance being formed. Instead, the heat causes the atoms or molecules within the rock to vibrate more rapidly, but the rock remains essentially the same material.\n\nNeither of these processes results in a chemical change where new substances are created, so option D is the correct choice.",
    "18986": "The answer is B. The metaphor suggests that despite the negative situation of losing his job, there was a positive aspect or opportunity for Connor to pursue a new career, which could be seen as a light in the midst of the darkness caused by the job loss. This implies that even though Connor was devastated by the loss of his job, he had the prospect of finding a new career, which could potentially lead to a better future.",
    "18989": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Francesca. \n\nTo explain further, in physics, a net force is the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object. If the forces are balanced, meaning they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, the net force on the object will be zero. This means that the object will remain in its current state of motion or will experience no acceleration. In this case, the force of gravity pulling Francesca down is 600N, and the force of the seat pushing her up is 1,200N. Since these forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. Therefore, the forces on Francesca are balanced, and there is no net force acting on her.",

    "21103": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of the gases, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its average speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (1,000 m/s). However, the masses of the particles differ:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 40 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 20 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies as follows:\n\nFor Sample A:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,000 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,000 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nNotice that the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A will be greater than the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Therefore, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature. In this case, Sample A has the higher average kinetic energy, so it also has the higher temperature.",
    "21104": "The answer is (B) 50\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 50\u00b0F is a more reasonable temperature for a cool glass of milk compared to 50\u00b0C.
