    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\" Jackhammers are known for being extremely loud, so the phrase implies that Mr. Herrera's snoring is quite noisy.",
    "7": "The answer is B. armored catfish.\n\nIn the image, we can see that the sturgeon has a mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward. This adaptation allows the sturgeon to easily access and consume food at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Discus: The discus is a type of fish that lives in freshwater environments like rivers and lakes. However, its mouth is not adapted for bottom feeding. Instead, it has a wide mouth that opens upwards, allowing it to feed on small prey items floating near the surface or in mid-water.\n\n(B) Armored catfish: The armored catfish, also known as the pangasius, is another type of fish that lives in freshwater environments like rivers and lakes. It has a mouth adapted for bottom feeding, similar to the sturgeon. The armored catfish has a wide mouth that opens downwards, allowing it to easily access and consume food at the bottom of its habitat.\n\nBased on the information provided and the image, the correct answer is option (B) armored catfish.",
    "8": "The answer is A. \n\nThis is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"to create\"), making it a complete thought or independent clause. It can be considered a run-on sentence if it were part of a larger sentence, but as a standalone statement, it is a complete sentence.",
    "13": "The answer is C. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n\nWendy's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This test aimed to determine if the additional nutrients had an effect on the production of insulin by the bacteria. By comparing the insulin production levels between the two groups of bacteria, Wendy could assess whether the extra nutrients were effective in increasing the insulin production by 20%, as she intended. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer to the question. Options A and B are not directly related to Wendy's specific goal of increasing insulin production by 20%.",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title format for a play, as it follows standard capitalization rules where the first word and all significant words in the title are capitalized.",
    "16": "The answer is B.",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns. \n\nSince Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, she has two copies of the dominant allele H. According to the context provided, the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). Therefore, Daffodil will express the dominant trait, which is not having horns. However, in this case, since the question asks specifically about the horns trait, and given that the allele for having horns (h) is recessive, Daffodil would be expected to have horns because she does not have any recessive alleles for having horns. Thus, her phenotype for the horns trait would be \"having horns.\"",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon. \n\nWhile both the bald eagle and the New Zealand falcon have strong, sharp talons that are adapted for grabbing and holding onto prey, the New Zealand falcon is known to be an excellent predator, especially in its native habitat. It is a small bird of prey that preys on small birds, reptiles, and insects. Its feet are adapted for grasping and holding onto its prey, allowing it to catch and kill its food with precision. The New Zealand falcon is also known for its agility and speed, making it a formidable predator in its natural environment. On the other hand, the sable is a type of weasel that primarily preys on small rodents, such as mice and voles. While its feet may be adapted for digging and catching prey, they are not as specialized for grabbing and holding onto prey as those of the New Zealand falcon or the bald eagle.",
    "36": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Mars using the given data:\n\n- Volume of Jupiter = 1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mars = 1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Jupiter's volume is compared to Mars' volume:\n\n(1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3) / (1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3) \u2248 8.79 x 10^3\n\nThis means that Jupiter's volume is approximately 8,790 times larger than Mars' volume. Since 8,790 is greater than 10,000, the statement \"Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars\" is true.\nSo, the answer is (A) true.\n",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we can say that the raindrops \"kissed\" the fans' cheeks, giving them a more lively and expressive description compared to simply saying they \"landed on\" the fans' cheeks.",
    "52": "The answer is C. \n\nEarthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.",
    "55": "The answer is A. Yes, Lithops bromfieldii is made up of many cells. \n\nLithops bromfieldii belongs to the plant kingdom, and plants are multicellular organisms. Each individual plant, including Lithops bromfieldii, consists of numerous cells that work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems. These cells are specialized to perform specific functions necessary for the survival and growth of the plant. For example, the leaves of Lithops bromfieldii contain chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis, allowing the plant to produce its own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. Therefore, Lithops bromfieldii is indeed composed of many cells.",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture.\n\nThe Cape vulture is a large bird of prey that is native to southern Africa. It has a hooked beak, which is an adaptation for tearing through meat. This beak allows the Cape vulture to efficiently break down the tough tissues of its prey, such as carrion or small animals. The sand martin, on the other hand, is a small insectivorous bird that has a pointed beak adapted for catching insects in flight. Therefore, the Cape vulture's beak is more suited for tearing through meat than the sand martin's beak.",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" is said while observing an ancient pug that seems to sleep all day. This implies that the speaker is using irony to express that the pug is not energetic at all, despite the literal meaning of the phrase.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"the prodigal son returned home\" comes from the Bible, specifically from the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15:11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 30 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 114 to 228 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as it is closer to the actual capacity of a car's gas tank.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho. According to the map, Idaho is located in the northern part of the United States, while Alabama, South Carolina, and Oklahoma are situated further south.",
    "74": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option provides specific context about where and how Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, indicating that it was learned rather than an innate or inherited trait. Option A only states that Austen can cook food over a fire, which does not necessarily imply that she learned how to build a fire; it could be something she already knew how to do. Therefore, option B offers more evidence supporting the conclusion that Austen acquired the trait of building a fire.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft. \n\nAll three objects - soccer shorts, jello, and an apron - can be considered soft or flexible to some degree. Soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a gelatinous substance that is soft and pliable, and an apron is typically made of soft, lightweight material like cotton or polyester. None of these objects are bouncy or hard.",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.",
    "81": "The answer is B.",
    "82": "The answer is B. sturgeon.\n\nSturgeons are bottom feeders that have a long, flattened snout with a wide mouth that opens sideways. This adaptation allows them to sift through the sediment at the bottom of rivers and lakes to find small invertebrates and other food sources. While clown triggerfish are known to be bottom feeders as well, they have a different mouth structure that is more suited for grazing on algae and other plant material found on the seafloor.",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 41\u00b0C is equivalent to approximately 106\u00b0F, which would be considered very hot rather than cold. On a cold, rainy day, the temperature is more likely to be in the range of 41\u00b0F or lower.",
    "101": "The answer is B. Sour. Both limes and dill pickles are known for their sour taste.",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is not shown to be consumed by any other organism in the food web, so it is not a consumer.",
    "113": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: \n  Distance = 555 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 555 km / 10 hours = 55.5 km/h\n\n- For option B:\n  Distance = 95 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 95 km / 10 hours = 9.5 km/h\n\n- For option C:\n  Distance = 460 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 460 km / 10 hours = 46 km/h\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Option A: 55.5 km/h\n- Option B: 9.5 km/h\n- Option C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is the one in option B, which moved at 9.5 km/h.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur.\" This is because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in a heterozygous genotype (Ff). However, since the allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f), Sasha will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which is short fur.",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. In this case, each part of the sentence expresses a complete thought:\n- \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud\" (independent clause)\n- \"we gave him a bath\" (independent clause)\n\nOption A, \"Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes,\" is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause. It does not have any conjunctions joining two or more independent clauses together.",
    "124": "The answer is C. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all the offspring have the genotype ee, which means they will have black eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0.",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Rosa's father has brown eyes, indicating that he likely passed the brown eye trait to Rosa through genetic inheritance. This is a common way in which traits are inherited from parents to offspring. Option A does not provide any direct evidence of genetic inheritance but rather a correlation between Rosa's hair and eye color, which may or may not be related.",

    "178": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and one subordinate idea (the source of that information).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence. It has an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"Although presidential elections take place in early November\").\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the correct answer among the given options, both A and B are technically correct as they are both complex sentences. But if we need to choose only one, then A would be the more appropriate choice as it provides additional context and information about the publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth.",

Therefore, there is a net force acting on Kylie, causing her to accelerate upwards due to the greater upward force exerted by the seat compared to the downward force of gravity.",
    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.",
    "664": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since the strength of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets and the orientation of their poles, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs as long as the distance between the magnets remains constant. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "722": "The answer is A. \n\nLeather belts typically range in length from around 80 to 120 centimeters (31 to 47 inches), depending on the size of the person wearing it. Therefore, option A (75 centimeters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option B (75 meters), as 75 meters would be an extremely long belt that is not practical or common for most people.",
    "724": "The answer is B. Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn both cases, heat is applied to the materials involved:\n- Melting glass involves heating the glass until it reaches its melting point, causing it to change from a solid to a liquid state.\n- Cooking an egg involves heating the egg until it changes from a raw, liquid state to a cooked, solid state, typically through the process of denaturing proteins within the egg.\n\nNeither of these processes results in a chemical change; they are primarily physical changes where the state or form of the material is altered without changing its chemical composition. Therefore, option B is the most accurate choice.",
    "725": "The answer is A. opaque. All three objects (steel beam, popcorn, and towel) are opaque, meaning they do not allow light to pass through them.",
    "727": "The answer is C. 70 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a leather belt is typically much shorter than 70 kilometers or 70 meters, as these measurements would be impractical for a belt. A standard leather belt is usually around 70-80 centimeters in length to fit comfortably around the waist.",
    "737": "The answer is A.\n\nThe passage describes the climate of Uganda, as it mentions the pattern of weather in the country, specifically that the forests are humid during April and May each year.

    "738": "The answer is B. 75 pounds. \n\nWhile goats can vary in size, an average adult goat typically weighs between 60 to 200 pounds. Therefore, 75 pounds would be a reasonable estimate for the mass of a goat.",
    "740": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense to mean something that is one-of-a-kind or unparalleled. The sentence states that the Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona was unique because it had significant implications for law enforcement, implying that it was a rare occurrence with a profound effect.\n\nOption B uses \"unique\" in a different context, where it means that the Miranda warning is not exclusive to the United States but is also practiced in other countries. This usage does not align with the traditional definition of \"unique.\"",
    "744": "The answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, both Solution A and Solution B have the same volume of solvent (30 mL). However, the number of yellow particles in each solution is different. Solution A has four yellow particles, while Solution B has five yellow particles. Since the concentration of a solution is defined as the ratio of the amount of solute to the total volume of the solution, we can calculate the concentration of each solution by dividing the number of yellow particles by the volume of the solvent.\n\nFor Solution A:\nConcentration = Number of yellow particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 4 yellow particles / 30 mL\nConcentration \u2248 0.133 particles/mL\n\nFor Solution B:\nConcentration = Number of yellow particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 5 yellow particles / 30 mL\nConcentration \u2248 0.167 particles/mL\n\nSince the concentration of Solution B is greater than that of Solution A, Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

    "825": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Paul, its height relative to the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external forces other than gravity are acting upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon did not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy must be balanced by an increase in its kinetic energy. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "829": "The answer is A. \n\nThe presence of white ash on the ground is a clear indication that a wildfire has occurred in the area. Ash is typically left behind after a fire has burned through an area, and its presence suggests that the fire has been active and intense enough to cause significant damage to the landscape. The other option, (B), is not relevant to the evidence of a wildfire shown in the image.",
    "837": "The answer is A. \n\nManuel noticed that the sky was filled with cumulus clouds every day last week. This statement describes the weather because it refers to the atmospheric conditions at a specific place and time (the sky being filled with cumulus clouds every day last week). Weather is defined as the short-term state of the atmosphere, while climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area. Since Manuel observed the same atmospheric condition consistently over a period of days, it indicates a description of the weather rather than the climate.",

Option A is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause.",
    "885": "The answer is B.",
    "891": "The answer is C. Sample B has the higher temperature because it has particles with a greater mass and a higher average speed compared to Sample A. According to the equation for the average kinetic energy of a gas particle, \\(KE_{avg} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle and \\(v\\) is its speed, the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles. Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and their speeds are also greater, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher. As temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas, Sample B will have a higher temperature.",

    "919": "The answer is A. Flamboyant cuttlefish. \n\nFlamboyant cuttlefish have bright, colorful patterns on their skin, which serve as a warning sign to potential predators. These patterns can be used to communicate with other cuttlefish or to deter predators by making them think the cuttlefish is larger or more dangerous than it actually is. The bright colors also help the cuttlefish blend into its environment, making it harder for predators to spot it. In contrast, impalas rely on their speed and agility to escape predators rather than relying on warning signs or camouflage.",
    "920": "The answer is A. \n\nDuring this time, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each pizza. As the pizzas were placed in a car or vehicle, they would have been exposed to the surrounding air temperature. Over time, the pizzas would have absorbed heat from their surroundings, causing their temperatures to increase. This process is known as heat transfer, where thermal energy moves from an object with a higher temperature to an object with a lower temperature until both objects reach thermal equilibrium. In this case, the pizzas were absorbing heat from the surrounding air, resulting in an increase in their temperatures.",

Both are chemical changes.\n\nRust forming on a bicycle frame involves the oxidation of iron, which is a chemical reaction where iron combines with oxygen to form iron oxide (rust). Grilling a hamburger involves the Maillard reaction, a complex series of chemical reactions that occur between amino acids and reducing sugars, leading to the development of flavor and color in cooked foods. Both processes involve chemical changes as they alter the composition of the materials involved.",
    "1051": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard involves separating iron from other materials without altering its chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are created or destroyed; it simply rearranges existing materials.\n- Sewing an apron is also a physical change. It involves manipulating fabric and thread to create a garment but does not involve any chemical reactions that would alter the materials' properties. The materials remain the same, just arranged differently.\n\nNeither of these activities results in a chemical change where new substances are formed, nor are they caused by heating or cooling. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

    "1691": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Samuel's parents had the trait of straight hair and passed it down genetically to Samuel, supporting the conclusion that Samuel inherited the trait. Option A does not provide evidence of genetic inheritance since it only states that Samuel and his father both have short hair, without specifying if they inherited the trait or if it was due to environmental factors.",
    "1692": "The answer is B.",
    "1693": "The answer is B. Mixing eggs, oil, and vinegar to make mayonnaise involves a chemical change because the ingredients undergo a reaction that results in the formation of a new substance with different properties than its components. Specifically, the egg yolk contains lecithin, which acts as an emulsifier, helping to stabilize the mixture by reducing the surface tension between the oil and water phases. This process leads to the formation of a stable emulsion, which is the characteristic of mayonnaise.",
    "1701": "The answer is A. \n\nIn the context provided, \"volcanic eruption\" better matches the sentence \"Lava comes out of the ground.\" This is because a volcanic eruption is the process by which molten rock, ash, and gases are expelled from a volcano, often resulting in lava flowing out of the ground. On the other hand, a flood typically refers to an overflow or excessive flow of water, which does not directly relate to the expulsion of lava from the ground.",
    "1705": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is larger than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker compared to the force between the magnets in Pair 2.",
    "1710": "The answer is A. The supply probably went down. \n\nThis conclusion can be drawn because the number of men's clothing stores decreased from seven to three. With fewer stores, it is likely that the total quantity of men's shirts available in Milford also decreased, leading to a reduction in the overall supply of men's shirts.",
    "1713": "The answer is B. As Emmett rode up the hill, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased because the height of the motorcycle relative to the ground increased.",
    "1716": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four squares contain the genotype BB or Bb, which means that all the offspring will have a brown body. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a white body to offspring with a brown body is 0:4.",

This novel features the main character, Dr. Henry Jekyll, who creates a potion that transforms him into the evil Mr. Hyde. The phrase \"Jekyll and Hyde\" is used to describe someone who exhibits completely different personalities or behaviors depending on the situation, often with one being good and the other being bad. Therefore, the source of the allusion is literature.",
    "1751": "The answer is B. The trait of naturally dark skin is typically inherited, as it is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to offspring. Skin color is influenced by multiple genes, and people with darker skin tones often have a higher concentration of melanin, a pigment that provides protection against ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This characteristic is usually present from birth and is not something that can be changed through environmental factors alone.",
    "1759": "The answer is A. Augusta.",
    "1764": "The answer is C. \n\nChloe can investigate whether small rocks or large rocks skip more times when thrown across the river using the supplies she has. She can throw both small and large flat rocks across the river and count the number of skips each rock makes. This will allow her to compare the skipping behavior of small versus large rocks in the same environment (the river). \n\nShe cannot investigate options A or B because she does not have access to a pond or round rocks. Option A requires comparing round and flat rocks, and option B requires comparing the river and a pond, neither of which are available to her.",
    "1767": "The answer is B. U.S. history.\n\nThe allusion to Benedict Arnold refers to the historical figure Benedict Arnold, who was an American Revolutionary War general who later defected to the British side during the war. This act of betrayal is well-known in U.S. history, making it a common reference point in discussions or stories involving themes of loyalty and betrayal.",
    "1770": "The answer is C. A pair of jeans is a solid because it has a definite shape and volume, unlike a liquid or gas that can take the shape of its container.",
    "1772": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, the pronoun \"they\" does not clearly refer to any specific noun in the sentence, making it a vague pronoun reference. Option A is clear because \"the servers\" is the subject that provides the coffee refills.",
    "1777": "The answer is A. \n\nThis answer is based on the statement \"Matthew knows a lot about history.\" This implies that Matthew has acquired knowledge or expertise in the field of history through some means. Option A suggests that Matthew learned history by reading, which is a plausible way to acquire knowledge in any subject, including history. Option B, while it could be true, does not directly support the conclusion that Matthew has acquired the trait of knowing a lot about history; it only provides additional information about his interests. Therefore, option A is more directly related to the conclusion drawn from the given statement.",

    "2657": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of the gases, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its average speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (1,600 m/s). However, the masses of the particles differ:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 40 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 26 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies directly using the masses:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the speeds are the same, the kinetic energy will be proportional to the mass. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B because the mass of the particles in Sample A is larger.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher, the temperature of Sample A is also higher than that of Sample B. Thus, the correct answer is (C) sample A.",

    "3160": "The answer is D. Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn the case of carving a piece of wood, the heat generated from the tool used to carve can cause the wood to expand or contract, potentially affecting the shape and size of the carved piece. However, the primary change here is the physical manipulation of the wood rather than a chemical reaction.\n\nFor water boiling on a stove, the primary change is a phase transition from liquid to gas due to an increase in temperature, which is a physical change. The heating process causes the water molecules to gain enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that keep them in a liquid state, resulting in the formation of steam.\n\nWhile both activities involve heating, the nature of the change differs between the two scenarios. Carving involves physical manipulation, while boiling involves a phase change. Therefore, option D is the most accurate choice as it correctly identifies the common cause of the changes in both situations.",

However, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be stronger. This is because the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets. Therefore, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.",
    "3417": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of a gas, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of its particles and the temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed is the same (\\( 1600 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)). However, the masses of the particles are different:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 16 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 32 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies directly using the masses:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nNotice that the speed term cancels out because it is the same for both samples. Therefore, the kinetic energy is proportional to the mass:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} \\propto 16 \\, \\text{u} \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} \\propto 32 \\, \\text{u} \\]\n\nSince the kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, the temperature of Sample B will be higher. Thus, the correct answer is (A) Sample B.",

Since Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll, the dominant allele (L) will express itself, resulting in a black coat.",
    "3453": "The answer is C. Sample B has the higher temperature because the average kinetic energy of its particles is greater than that of Sample A. Since both samples have the same number of particles with the same mass, the difference in their average particle speeds results in a difference in their average kinetic energies. The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature of the sample. Therefore, Sample B, with an average particle speed of 800 m/s, has a higher temperature compared to Sample A, with an average particle speed of 620 m/s.",

    "3909": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Serengeti National Park is located in Tanzania, a country in eastern Africa. Eastern Africa experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, the area receives heavy rainfall, while during the dry season, there is little to no precipitation. This seasonal pattern affects the vegetation and wildlife in the region, as plants grow and animals migrate in response to the changing weather conditions.\n\nIn addition to the seasonal rainfall, the soil in the Serengeti National Park is generally poor in nutrients. This is due to the type of vegetation found in the area, which consists mainly of grasses and shrubs. These plants have shallow root systems and do not retain much nutrients in the soil. As a result, the soil in the park is often low in fertility, which can limit the growth of certain plant species and affect the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, option B better describes the Serengeti National Park ecosystem, as it takes into account both the seasonal rainfall patterns and the nutrient-poor soil conditions. Option A, on the other hand, incorrectly states that the park has year-round rain, which is not accurate given the presence of distinct wet and dry seasons in the region.",

    "4982": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of the gases, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (1,100 m/s). However, the masses of the particles are different:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 44 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 26 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies directly using the masses:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 44 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,100 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,100 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the speeds are the same, the kinetic energy will be proportional to the mass. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B because the mass of the particles in Sample A is larger.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher, the temperature of Sample A is also higher than that of Sample B. Thus, the correct answer is (C) sample A.",

This indicates that heat was being lost from the aquariums to their surroundings, resulting in a decrease in temperature.",
    "5575": "The answer is A. fuzzy fruit. \n\nThis is because the tomato plant has the homozygous genotype \"ff\" for the fruit texture gene, where \"f\" represents the allele for fuzzy fruit. Since the allele for fuzzy fruit (f) is recessive, the plant will express the phenotype associated with the recessive allele, which in this case is fuzzy fruit.",
    "5579": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and their size and shape. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have the same magnetic strength. However, the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2. Thus, the statement \"The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs\" is false. The correct answer is C.",

This test would help him determine which design met the requirement that the concert area should be at least 150 meters away from the road to minimize traffic noise. By comparing the distances measured for each design, Edward could identify the one that best satisfies this condition. However, it is important to note that the test does not provide any information about whether at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees or if the designs meet other requirements set by the city council. Therefore, options A and C cannot be confirmed as the results of Edward's test.",
    "5619": "The answer is C. \n\nIn Pair 1, there is one bar magnet and one horseshoe magnet, while in Pair 2, there are two bar magnets. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be stronger.

    "7296": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the image, one magnet is oriented with its north pole facing downward, while the other magnet is oriented with its south pole facing upward. Since opposite poles attract each other, these magnets will attract each other.",
    "7297": "The answer is B. Euphemism.\n\nIn this context, the phrase \"stay away from the ocean\" is an example of a euphemism, as it is a polite way of saying that Jennifer should not enter the water without knowing how to swim. Euphemisms are often used to soften or avoid direct or harsh language, making them more appropriate in certain situations.",
    "7298": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, the word \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense to describe each individual item in Samantha's collection of handmade pottery, emphasizing their distinctiveness and individuality. This usage aligns with the traditional definition of \"unique,\" meaning something that is one-of-a-kind or different from others. Option A uses \"unique\" in a more figurative sense, referring to Samantha herself as an artist who stands out due to her work being featured in a publication, rather than describing each piece of pottery individually.",
    "7326": "The answer is A. \n\nSince \"cattle\" is the first word and \"code\" is the second word in the given guide words, any word that falls between these two words alphabetically will be found on the same page as \"cattle\". Therefore, \"crumb\" would be the correct choice because it comes after \"cattle\" but before \"code\" in alphabetical order.",
    "7328": "The answer is A. The wettest months of the year are June, July, and August.\n\nThis can be determined by looking at the height of the bars on the graph, which represent the average precipitation in inches for each month.

    "7343": "The answer is B. Crocodylus acutus.",
    "7344": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"From the look on her face, Camille is carrying an albatross around her neck\" comes from the poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In the poem, the albatross symbolizes a burden or curse that the mariner must carry as punishment for killing the bird, which was considered a sign of good luck. The phrase \"carrying an albatross around one's neck\" has since become a common idiom to describe being burdened with a problem or responsibility.",
    "7345": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests a direct genetic link between Mason and his biological father, as the inheritance of eye color traits often follows a pattern where dominant traits can be passed down through generations. If Mason's father has hazel eyes, it could indicate that Mason inherited the gene responsible for hazel eyes from him. However, it's important to note that eye color can also be influenced by other factors such as environmental conditions or other genetic variations, but the presence of a similar trait in a parent strongly supports the idea of inheritance. \n\nOptions B and C do not provide evidence directly related to Mason's genetic inheritance of the hazel eye trait. Option B mentions that Mason and his sisters wear glasses, which does not necessarily imply anything about their eye color genetics. Option C states that Mason's friend has hazel eyes, which is an observation about someone else and does not provide any information about Mason's own genetic inheritance.",
    "7346": "The answer is B. Dover.",
    "7347": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases, there is a reaction between substances that results in new substances being formed. For acid rain weathering a marble statue, the acid rain reacts with the calcium carbonate in the marble, causing it to break down into other compounds. Similarly, in a battery reacting to power a flashlight, the chemicals inside the battery undergo a chemical reaction to produce electricity, which powers the flashlight. Therefore, both scenarios involve chemical changes.",
    "7355": "The answer is B. Air inside a raft is a gas.",
    "7356": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Lauren's father has brown eyes. He passed this trait down to Lauren\" provides evidence that Lauren inherited the brown eye trait from her father, supporting the conclusion that she has brown eyes due to genetic inheritance. Option A does not provide any direct evidence of genetic inheritance but rather a correlation between hair and eye color, which is not necessarily indicative of the same trait being inherited.",
    "7357": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Britney has developed the ability to play the cello through learning, which aligns with the conclusion that she has acquired the trait of being able to play the cello. Options A and C provide additional context but do not directly support the conclusion that Britney has acquired the trait of playing the cello.",
    "7359": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Belize Barrier Reef is located in the Caribbean Sea, which is known for its warm and shallow waters. This makes it an ideal habitat for various marine life, including fish, corals, and other organisms that thrive in these conditions. Additionally, the Belize Barrier Reef is a tropical coral reef ecosystem, which means that it receives plenty of sunlight throughout the year, providing the necessary energy for photosynthesis and growth of the coral reefs. Therefore, option B better describes the Belize Barrier Reef ecosystem as it has bright sunlight and shallow water. Option A is incorrect because the Belize Barrier Reef does not have only a few types of organisms; it is home to a diverse range of marine life.",
    "7361": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is important to use proper capitalization and punctuation. Option A uses \"Dear\" with a capital \"D,\" followed by the recipient's name in title case (\"Aunt\" capitalized and \"Becky\" in lowercase). Option B omits the capitalization of \"Dear\" and uses lowercase for the recipient's name, which is incorrect according to standard writing conventions. Therefore, option A is the correct choice for a formal greeting in a letter.",

    "7375": "The answer is A.",
    "7389": "The answer is B. The text uses an ad hominem fallacy by attacking Mr. Conway personally rather than addressing his argument about workplace safety. The statement \"I doubt that someone so socially awkward would know a thing about office safety\" is a personal attack on Mr. Conway, rather than focusing on the validity of his argument or the evidence he presents.",
    "7391": "The answer is B. A drum is considered a good because it is a physical object that can be bought, sold, or used in various contexts such as music, percussion, or as part of a musical instrument set.

    "7429": "The answer is B. Appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good. \n\nIn the given text, the argument suggests that since ancient ancestors ran without shoes, running shoes cannot be beneficial for modern-day people. This is an example of appealing to nature, as it assumes that because something was done naturally in the past, it must be the best or most appropriate way to do it now. It does not consider other factors such as modern technology, physical conditions, or individual needs.",
    "7442": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is 1 inch, while in Pair 2, the distance between the magnets is 2 inches. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1.",
    "7443": "The answer is C. \n\nIn the food web, the black racer is shown to be preyed upon by the bobcat, gray fox, and black bear. Therefore, the matter contained within the black racer will eventually move to these predators as they consume it. The parasol fungus is not directly connected to the black racer in the food web, so its matter does not move to the parasol fungus.",
    "7448": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Making paper from wood involves breaking down wood fibers into pulp and then recombining them to form sheets of paper. This process includes chemical reactions that break down lignin and other components of the wood to make it suitable for paper production. Therefore, making paper from wood is a chemical change.\n- Rusting on a metal gate is a chemical reaction where iron combines with oxygen and water to form iron oxide (rust). This process is also a chemical change.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions, so they share the characteristic of being chemical changes.",
    "7455": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine the word that would be found between \"alphabet\" and \"area\" in a dictionary, we need to look for a word that comes alphabetically after \"alphabet\" but before \"area\". Among the options given:\n\n- \"Ahead\" comes after \"alphabet\" but before \"area\".\n- \"Antenna\" also comes after \"alphabet\" but before \"area\".\n\nSince both options fit the criteria, but typically only one option is correct based on the context provided, it seems there might be an error or additional context needed to choose between them. However, based on the given options, either could be correct depending on the specific dictionary being used. If we must choose one, \"ahead\" is more commonly used as a guide word in dictionaries.",
    "7459": "The answer is B. The text uses an oxymoron, as \"genuine imitation\" is a contradictory phrase. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two seemingly contradictory or opposite terms. In this case, \"genuine\" implies authenticity, while \"imitation\" suggests something that is not real, thus creating a contradiction.",
    "7460": "The answer is B. Climate.

In this case, the netleaf oak trees, the Mexican spotted owls, and the brush mice all live in the same area (the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range) and interact with each other. Therefore, they form a community. The other options only describe individual organisms or elements of the environment, rather than a group of organisms interacting with each other.",
    "7723": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and the strength of their magnetic fields. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, they have similar magnetic field strengths. However, the size of the magnets can affect the strength of their magnetic fields. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields than smaller ones. In Pair 2, the magnets are larger than those in Pair 1, so the magnetic force between them will be greater. Therefore, the statement that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 is true.",

    "7745": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is smaller compared to Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be stronger in Pair 1 where the distance is smaller.",
    "7747": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Sandeep, its height relative to the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external forces other than gravity are acting upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon did not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy must be balanced by an increase in its kinetic energy. Therefore, as the water balloon falls, its gravitational potential energy decreases.",
    "7748": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Gabriel's parents had straight hair, which implies they likely inherited the trait from their own parents as well. Since straight hair is a hereditary trait, it is reasonable to conclude that Gabriel inherited the trait from his parents. Option B does not provide any information about the inheritance pattern or the genetic basis of the hair type, making it less supportive of the conclusion that Gabriel inherited the trait.",
    "7755": "The answer is C. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- **A Penny Tarnishing:** When a penny tarnishes, it undergoes a chemical reaction where copper in the penny reacts with oxygen in the air to form copper oxide. This process is a chemical change because new substances (copper oxide) are formed as a result of the reaction.\n  \n- **Firing a Clay Pot in a Hot Kiln:** When clay is fired in a kiln, it undergoes a series of chemical reactions that transform the clay into ceramic. These reactions include the melting and recrystallization of minerals within the clay, leading to the formation of new compounds and structures. This is also a chemical change.\n\nBoth processes involve the formation of new substances through chemical reactions, making option C the correct choice.",

    "10055": "The answer is A. Cape vulture.\n\nCape vultures are birds of prey that are adapted for flight. They have strong wings and powerful muscles that allow them to soar through the air with ease. Their keen eyesight helps them spot their prey from great distances, and they use their sharp talons to catch and kill their food. In contrast, the gaur is a large herbivorous mammal native to South and Southeast Asia, and it is not adapted for flight. Instead, it is adapted for running and swimming, as well as for foraging for food on the ground.",
    "10059": "The answer is B.",
    "10060": "The answer is A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie. \n\nThis is because the force of gravity pulling down on Cassie is 600N, while the seat of the cart is pushing up on her with a force of 1,200N. Since these two forces are acting in opposite directions, they are not balanced. Therefore, there is a net force acting on Cassie, which is equal to the difference between the upward force and the downward force: 1,200N - 600N = 600N upwards. This net force is causing Cassie to accelerate upwards, which is why she feels pushed into the seat during the loop.",
    "10077": "The answer is D. It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.\n\nBased on the text, scientists used fossil evidence to determine that beetles have low extinction rates compared to other animals. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. By comparing the number of extinct beetle species to the number of other extinct species, scientists could understand why there are so many different beetle species today. The text states, \"Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever.\" This information helps explain the large number of beetle species that exist today.",

    "11779": "The answer is B. Ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. \n\nIn this case, the statement \"How could Hazel have anything insightful to say about foreign affairs? She grew up on a farm.\" is an ad hominem fallacy because it attacks the person (Hazel) instead of addressing the actual argument or evidence presented by her regarding foreign affairs. It assumes that because Hazel grew up on a farm, she cannot have any insights into foreign affairs, which is a personal attack rather than a critique of her knowledge or arguments related to foreign affairs.",
    "11786": "The answer is D. 17 millimeters. \n\nCaterpillars typically range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters, so 17 millimeters would be a reasonable estimate for the length of a caterpillar. 17 centimeters, 17 meters, and 17 kilometers are much larger than the typical size of a caterpillar, making them less likely estimates.",
    "11789": "The answer is B. black bear.\n\nIn the food web, the black bear is shown to eat the swallowtail caterpillar, which is a primary consumer. The black bear is also shown to eat the pine vole, which is a secondary consumer. Therefore, the black bear is a tertiary consumer in this food web.",
    "11792": "The answer is A. Dolostone is a rock. \n\nDolostone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate). It is formed through the precipitation of calcium magnesium carbonate from seawater, typically in shallow marine environments. Dolostone does not have a fixed crystal structure like minerals, but rather forms as a solid mass with a more complex texture. While it is naturally occurring, it is not classified as a mineral because it lacks a specific chemical composition and crystalline structure that are required to be considered a mineral. Instead, dolostone is classified as a rock based on its physical properties and formation process.",

    "11826": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to complete the sentence with a word that gives the door a human-like quality. \"Protested\" implies that the door is reacting to Tammy's action by showing resistance or disagreement, which is a characteristic typically associated with humans. Therefore, option B fits the context of personification better than option A, which simply describes the door's movement without attributing any human-like qualities to it.",
    "11830": "The answer is A. Circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself. \n\nIn this case, Mr. Harding's ability to quit smoking is being used as evidence for his capability to stop smoking, which is essentially restating the same idea without providing any new information or evidence.

    "11851": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, the sentence \"At the farmer's market, bright red tomatoes () a bountiful harvest\" can be completed with \"boasted of\" to give the tomatoes a human-like quality by attributing them with pride or boasting about their abundance. This makes the sentence more vivid and engaging. \n\nSo, the complete sentence would be: \"At the farmer's market, bright red tomatoes boasted of a bountiful harvest.\"",
    "11863": "The answer is B. \n\nText message B is more formal because it uses proper capitalization, punctuation, and includes the title \"Ms.\" before the name, which adds a level of formality to the communication.

    "11873": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the food web, the black rockfish is shown to be preyed upon by the orca. Therefore, any matter consumed by the black rockfish will eventually move up the food chain to the orca. Since the bat star is also shown to be preyed upon by the orca, it follows that any matter consumed by the bat star would also eventually move up the food chain to the orca. However, since the question asks for the organism that contains matter that eventually moves to the bat star, the correct answer is the black rockfish.",

    "12482": "The answer is B. The scar on Sam's right knee is an acquired trait because it is a result of an event that occurred in Sam's life, such as an injury or surgery, rather than being determined by genetic factors passed down from his parents. Inherited traits are those that are passed down through generations based on genetic material, while acquired traits are developed during an individual's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences.",
    "12484": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Scarlett has acquired her knowledge of history through learning, which aligns with the statement that she \"knows a lot about history.\" It implies an active process of acquiring knowledge rather than just being interested in a specific area or having a natural aptitude for it. Option A only indicates interest but does not necessarily imply that Scarlett has acquired extensive knowledge about history.",
    "12485": "The answer is B. Appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good. \n\nIn the given text, the author argues that since pasteurization is a human invention, it is better to drink raw milk because it is \"pure\" and \"unchanged.\" This is an appeal to nature fallacy, as it assumes that natural things are inherently better or more beneficial than those that are not natural. The text does not provide any evidence to support the claim that raw milk is better for health compared to pasteurized milk; rather, it relies on the idea that something being natural makes it superior.",

Therefore, \"postage\" would not be found on a dictionary page with those specific guide words.",
    "14184": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this scenario, both objects are identical in mass (100 grams) and are made of the same material (cider). The only difference between them is their temperature. Since thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, the object with the higher temperature will have more thermal energy. Therefore, the 100-gram mug of cider at 75\u00b0C has more thermal energy than the one at 60\u00b0C.",
    "14189": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the guide words \"tap\" and \"than,\" the word that would be found between them in a dictionary is \"temper.\" This is because \"temper\" comes alphabetically after \"tap\" and before \"than.\"",
    "14198": "The answer is B. \n\nA can of soda pop typically holds around 315 milliliters (ml), which is a more reasonable and practical estimate compared to 315 liters. 315 liters would be an extremely large quantity for a single can of soda pop, as it is equivalent to about 315,000 ml or 315,000 cubic centimeters. This is far beyond the capacity of any standard soda can, which usually ranges between 240-355 ml. Therefore, option B (315 milliliters) is the better estimate for the volume of a can of soda pop.",
    "14209": "The answer is B. July. \n\nAccording to the bar graph, the average precipitation in London during July is the lowest among all the months shown.",

    "14225": "The answer is B. giant pangolin.\n\nThe giant pangolin is an animal that has a unique adaptation for protecting itself from predators with sharp teeth. It has a thick layer of scales covering most of its body, which makes it difficult for predators to penetrate and attack. This adaptation is particularly useful in defending against predators like lions, leopards, and crocodiles, which are known to prey on pangolins. In contrast, the hyrax does not have such a protective layer of scales and is more vulnerable to attacks by predators with sharp teeth.",
    "14228": "The answer is B.\n\nThe passage describes the weather in Death Valley, as it mentions a specific event that occurred on a particular date, such as the record high temperature of 134\u00b0F recorded on July 10, 1913. This is an example of describing the atmospheric conditions at a certain place and time, which is characteristic of weather. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a certain place, so it would not be appropriate to use the term \"climate\" to describe a single event or short period of time.",

They form the base of the food web and are typically plants or algae. In this case, the bear sedge is a plant that can produce its own food through photosynthesis, making it the producer in this food web. The brown lemming is a consumer, as it eats other organisms, and the mushroom is a decomposer, breaking down dead organic matter.",
    "14247": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Stretching a rubber band involves changing its shape without altering its fundamental composition or properties. This is a physical change because no new substances are formed.\n- An iceberg melting slowly involves the transformation of ice into water due to an increase in temperature. This is also a physical change as it does not involve the formation of any new substances; it merely changes the state of matter from solid to liquid.\n\nNeither of these processes involves a chemical reaction where new substances are created, so they are both classified as physical changes.",
    "14248": "The answer is B. \n\nIn a dictionary, words are arranged in alphabetical order. The guide words \"battle\" and \"bounty\" indicate that any word found between these two will start with a letter between 'b' and 'b'.

    "14277": "The answer is B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kinsley. \n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n- The force of gravity pulling down on Kinsley is 600N.\n- The force of the seat pushing up on Kinsley is 1,200N.\n\nSince these two forces are acting in opposite directions, we can calculate the net force by subtracting the smaller force from the larger one:\n\\[ \\text{Net Force} = \\text{Force Up} - \\text{Force Down} = 1,200\\, \\text{N} - 600\\, \\text{N} = 600\\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nSince the net force is not zero, the forces are unbalanced, and there is a net force of 600N acting upwards on Kinsley. This means that Kinsley is accelerating upwards due to the unbalanced forces.",
    "14281": "The answer is B. The text uses a hasty generalization because it makes a broad claim about all literature classes being dull based on a single observation of Mr. McClure's class. This type of reasoning is flawed as it assumes that one instance represents the entire group without considering other possible factors or experiences.",

    "14316": "The answer is C. \n\nVictoria can use the garlic spray as a variable to see if it affects the deer's preference for eating bean plants. By comparing the number of leaves eaten from bean plants sprayed with garlic spray versus those that were not sprayed, she can determine if the garlic spray influences the deer's behavior. This experiment directly addresses the question of whether the deer eat fewer leaves from bean plants sprayed with garlic spray compared to unsprayed bean plants. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no coffee spray mentioned in the supplies list, so it cannot be used in the experiment. Option B is also incorrect because there are no squash plants listed among the supplies, making it impossible to compare the deer's preference between tomato and squash plants.",
    "14321": "The answer is B. Fiji. The highlighted area in the map corresponds to the location of Fiji, an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean.",

    "14333": "The answer is A. It has mostly small plants.\n\nThe Tibetan Plateau is a tundra ecosystem, which means that it has cold temperatures year-round and very little precipitation. These conditions make it difficult for large plants to grow, so the ecosystem is dominated by small plants such as grasses, mosses, and lichens. Additionally, the high altitude of the plateau means that there is less oxygen available, which can also limit plant growth. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because tundra ecosystems typically have cold temperatures year-round, rather than warm summers and cool winters.",
    "14334": "The answer is A. \n\nThis is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"the Guadalupe Mountains National Park\") and a predicate (\"offers one of the finest examples of an ancient marine reef\"). It expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.",

    "14350": "The answer is A.",
    "14359": "The answer is B. \n\nThis passage describes the climate because it refers to the pattern of weather in a certain place, specifically mentioning that winter is the rainiest season of the year. Climate is defined as the long-term pattern of weather conditions in a specific area, while weather refers to the short-term state of the atmosphere at a particular location and time. Therefore, the statement about the rainiest season in Cole's location is describing the climate rather than the weather.",
    "14363": "The answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, both Solution A and Solution B have the same volume of solvent (35 mL). However, the number of purple particles in each solution is different. Solution A has 6 purple particles, while Solution B has 4 purple particles. Since the volume of the solvent is the same for both solutions, the concentration of the purple particles can be determined by dividing the number of particles by the volume of the solvent. \n\nFor Solution A:\nConcentration = Number of particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 6 particles / 35 mL\n\nFor Solution B:\nConcentration = Number of particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 4 particles / 35 mL\n\nComparing the concentrations, we find that Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles than Solution B. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Solution A.",
    "14366": "The answer is A. It makes its own food.\n\nIn a food chain, producers are organisms that can produce their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Producers are typically plants or algae, as they use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which serves as their energy source. In this case, the cotton bush is a plant, so it can make its own food through photosynthesis. The red-legged grasshopper consumes the cotton bush, making it a primary consumer, while the eastern bluebird consumes the grasshopper, making it a secondary consumer.",

    "14687": "The answer is B. The text uses a false dichotomy by presenting only two choices: either Shawna is coming to the party or she doesn't like the speaker. This ignores other possibilities such as Shawna being unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances or simply not being interested in attending but not wanting to hurt the speaker's feelings.",
    "14690": "The answer is A. \n\nNick can use the dining room table and the picnic table in his backyard as different locations to place the two freshly painted watercolor pictures. By comparing the drying times between the two locations, he can investigate whether watercolor paintings dry faster when they are placed inside or outside. This experiment will help him understand the effect of environmental factors like temperature and humidity on the drying process of watercolor paintings. \n\nOption B cannot be investigated because there is no fan available among the supplies. Option C cannot be investigated because Nick does not have two watercolor paintings of different sizes; both are of the same size.",
    "14691": "The answer is B. True.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Mars and Mercury. According to the table:\n\n- Volume of Mars = 160 billion km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mercury = 60 billion km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Mars' volume is compared to Mercury's:\n\nMars' volume / Mercury's volume = 160 billion km\u00b3 / 60 billion km\u00b3 \u2248 2.67\n\nSince 2.67 is less than 3, the statement that \"the volume of Mars is more than three times as large as Mercury's\" is false. Therefore, the correct answer is A. False.",
    "14695": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"Elijah had a growth spurt, and now most of his pants are too short,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"and.\" This makes it a compound sentence because each clause can stand alone as a complete thought.\n\nOption B, \"During last night's game, the tall, lanky girl easily spiked the volleyball over the net and blocked all the other team's hits,\" contains one independent clause with a dependent clause introduced by the word \"During.\" This makes it a complex sentence, not a compound sentence.",
    "14701": "The answer is C. Straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against.\n\nIn this case, Brett's argument is that American schools should offer foreign language classes at every level. The response to this argument is a straw man fallacy because it misrepresents Brett's position by suggesting that he is arguing against the value of learning English, rather than his actual stance on offering foreign language classes. The response is attacking a weaker version of Brett's argument, making it easier to argue against him.",

In this case, option C (35\u00b0F) appears to be the closest match to the temperature shown on the thermometer.",
    "14709": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, the sentence can be completed with \"breathed\" to give the bus a human-like quality, making it seem as if the bus is exerting effort to climb the steep and rocky path. So, the complete sentence would read: \"The path was steep and rocky, and the bus breathed hard as it made a slow ascent.\"",
    "14712": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., won him a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects,\" there is an independent clause (\"Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\") and a dependent clause (\"won him a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the design winning the medal) and one subordinate idea (the design being of the Lincoln Memorial). Option A is a simple sentence as it only contains one independent clause without any dependent clauses.",
    "14720": "The answer is A. False causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other. \n\nIn this case, the statement assumes that companies making huge profits must be exploiting their customers simply because they are making large profits. This is an example of false causation, as it incorrectly infers a cause-and-effect relationship between the two events without sufficient evidence to support such a conclusion. It does not consider alternative explanations or factors that might contribute to a company's profitability, such as efficient management, innovative products, or strong market demand.",

    "16220": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests a direct genetic link between Henry and his biological father regarding the eye color trait, as eye color is typically an inherited characteristic passed down through genes. The fact that Henry's father wears contacts to achieve the same eye color as Henry implies that they share the same genetic predisposition for hazel eyes, supporting the conclusion that Henry inherited this trait from his father. \n\nOptions B and C do not provide evidence directly related to Henry's inheritance of the hazel eye trait. Option B mentions Henry wearing glasses like his sisters, but this does not indicate any genetic connection or inheritance of the eye color trait. Option C states that Henry's friend also has hazel eyes, which could be coincidental and does not necessarily imply that Henry inherited the trait from his friend. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice to support the conclusion that Henry inherited the hazel eye trait.",

This literary reference makes the allusion.",
    "16819": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. According to the inverse square law, the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Therefore, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is larger, the magnetic force between them will be weaker compared to the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2, where the distance is smaller.",
    "16825": "The answer is B. Ff.",
    "16830": "The answer is A. The colder helium balloon has less thermal energy.

Since the average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to their temperature, Sample A will have a higher temperature than Sample B.",
    "16882": "The answer is B. Inherited. \n\nRebecca's naturally blond hair is an example of a trait that is passed down through genetics, making it an inherited trait. Hair color is determined by the presence or absence of certain pigments in the hair follicles, which are influenced by genetic factors. Since Rebecca has naturally blond hair, it suggests that she likely inherited the genes responsible for producing light-colored hair from her parents. This is different from acquired traits, which are changes in an organism that occur during its lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences, rather than being determined by its genetic makeup.",

It expresses a complete thought and conveys a clear idea or statement. Option A, \"We went to Texas, we saw an old fort,\" is not a complete sentence because it lacks a proper subject and predicate structure; it appears to be a fragment or part of a larger sentence.",
    "16898": "The answer is B. \n\nIn titles of TV shows, it is common to use quotation marks around the title to indicate that it is a specific work or name. This is different from the use of asterisks (*) which are often used to denote emphasis or to highlight certain words within a title. Therefore, option B is the correct way to present the title of the TV show.",
    "16901": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the passage, Brandon tested the filter by measuring how quickly water moved through it. This test would help him determine if the filter was clogged or not. If the water moves slowly through the filter, it indicates that the filter is clogged and needs to be replaced. On the other hand, if the water flows quickly through the filter, it suggests that the filter is not clogged and does not need to be replaced yet. Therefore, Brandon's test could show whether the filter was clogged or not. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about testing an inexpensive filter. Option C is also incorrect as the test measures the flow rate of water through the filter, not the amount of bacteria in the water before it was filtered.",
    "16921": "The answer is C. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are aligned such that opposite poles (N and S) are facing each other, resulting in an attractive force between them. In Pair 2, the magnets are also aligned with opposite poles facing each other, creating an attractive force as well. Since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same (3 inches), and all the magnets are made of the same material, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.",
    "16922": "The answer is B. Having a graying coat. \n\nSince Maverick has the heterozygous genotype Gg, he has one dominant allele (G) and one recessive allele (g). In this case, the dominant allele (G) is for having a graying coat, so Maverick will express the phenotype associated with that dominant allele, which means he will have a graying coat.",
    "16923": "The answer is A. \n\nIn this context, the phrase \"put their dog to sleep\" is an euphemism, which is a polite or indirect way of expressing something unpleasant or harsh.

    "17927": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn this case, both samples have the same average particle speed (1,200 m/s), but the mass of the particles differs between the two samples. Sample A has particles with a mass of 36 u, while Sample B has particles with a mass of 32 u.\n\nSince the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the difference in temperature will be determined by the difference in the masses of the particles. According to the formula for kinetic energy (KE = 0.5 * m * v^2), where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity, the particle in Sample A (with a mass of 36 u) will have a higher kinetic energy than the particle in Sample B (with a mass of 32 u).\n\nTherefore, since the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher than that in Sample B, Sample A has the higher temperature.",

    "18434": "The answer is B. Each cake . . . the surroundings\n\nDuring the time shown in the table, the temperature of both cakes decreased. This indicates that thermal energy was transferred from the cakes to their surroundings, as the cakes were cooling down. The decrease in temperature suggests that heat was being lost from the cakes to the environment around them, such as the air or surfaces they were placed on.",
    "18443": "The answer is B.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the average particle speed is 2,700 m/s, while in Sample B, the average particle speed is 2,600 m/s. Since both samples have the same mass of each particle (16 u), the difference in their average particle speeds will result in a difference in their average kinetic energies.\n\nThe formula for kinetic energy is:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity (or speed) of the particle.\n\nSince the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the difference in their average kinetic energies will be determined by the difference in their average particle speeds. As the average particle speed in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A will also be greater.\n\nTherefore, Sample A has the higher temperature because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy compared to those in Sample B.",

    "19954": "The answer is A. Ethos (character).\n\nThe advertisement uses the ethos appeal by presenting the Ashton-Baker Credit Union as an institution that has been protecting people's money since 1902. This establishes the credit union's credibility and trustworthiness, which is important for building confidence in their services. By highlighting their long history of protecting customers' money, the ad appeals to the audience's sense of character and reputation, rather than relying solely on logic or emotional appeals.",
    "19958": "The answer is E. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four boxes contain the genotype \"Ee\". This means that all of the offspring will have one dominant allele (E) and one recessive allele (e). Since the allele for curled ears (E) is dominant, all of the offspring will have curled ears. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4 or 0:4.",

The other options involve trading items that either don't match the preferences or aren't present in the lunches shown in the images.",
    "19976": "The answer is C. Soap bars typically contain fragrances or scents that can be detected by the sense of smell. Gold bracelets and metal trombones generally do not emit any noticeable smell unless they have been treated with certain chemicals or coatings that could potentially give off an odor.",
    "19977": "The answer is B. sedimentary. \n\nLimestone is a sedimentary rock that forms when layers of ocean sediment are pressed together to form rock. This process involves the compaction and cementation of sediments, such as shells, coral, and other organic materials, into a solid rock. The presence of fossils in the limestone, like the dark, round shapes seen in the image, further supports its classification as a sedimentary rock. Metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, are formed by the transformation of pre-existing rocks through heat, pressure, or chemical processes, rather than through the compaction and cementation of sediments.",
    "19980": "The answer is C. Oregon. \n\nIn the map, Oregon is located in the western part of the United States, while Kansas, Kentucky, and Arizona are situated more towards the central and eastern regions. Therefore, Oregon is the state that is farthest west among the given options.",

    "20098": "The answer is B. \n\nSince \"blubber\" falls between the guide words \"barn\" and \"beetle,\" it would not be found on a dictionary page with those specific guide words. Guide words help readers locate entries in alphabetical order within a dictionary. If \"blubber\" were to appear in the dictionary, it would be placed after \"beetle\" because \"blubber\" starts with the letter 'b' and comes alphabetically after 'beetle'. Therefore, it wouldn't be found between \"barn\" and \"beetle.\"",

    "21098": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine which goose was moving at a higher speed, we need to calculate the speed of each goose by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\nFor option A:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 640 miles / 10 hours\nSpeed = 64 miles per hour\n\nFor option B:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 290 miles / 10 hours\nSpeed = 29 miles per hour\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Goose in option A: 64 miles per hour\n- Goose in option B: 29 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the goose in option A was moving at a higher speed.",
    "21099": "The answer is A. \n\nIn the image, the hockey player is using his hockey stick to push the puck down the ice. This means that the direction of the push is away from the hockey stick, as the puck is being propelled in the opposite direction.",
    "21100": "The answer is B. An egg white is a liquid.",
    "21102": "The answer is A. A book is considered a good because it is a tangible item that can be physically owned, read, and stored. It provides value to the consumer by offering information, entertainment, or education. Services, on the other hand, are intangible actions or activities that are performed for the consumer, such as consulting, cleaning, or transportation.",
    "21103": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of each sample, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its average speed.\n\nFor Sample A:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_A \\)) = 40 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_A \\)) = 1,000 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,000 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_B \\)) = 20 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_B \\)) = 1,000 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,000 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince both samples have the same average particle speed, the average kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Therefore, Sample A, with particles that are twice as massive as those in Sample B, will have a higher average kinetic energy.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy, it also has a higher temperature compared to Sample B. Thus, the correct answer is (C) sample A.",
    "21104": "The answer is (B) 50\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 50\u00b0F is a more reasonable temperature for a cool glass of milk compared to 50\u00b0C. At 50\u00b0C, the milk would be very hot and uncomfortable to drink, whereas 50\u00b0F is a typical temperature for a cold beverage that is enjoyable to consume.",
    "21109": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Nellie by associating her with her sister who only watches reality television, implying that Nellie might also be watching reality television as well. This is an attempt to discredit Nellie based on the actions of another person, rather than providing evidence or facts about Nellie's own behavior.",
    "21114": "The answer is A. \n\nIn the food web, the grizzly bear is shown to be a consumer of the barren-ground caribou. When the grizzly bear consumes the barren-ground caribou, it ingests the matter within its body. As the grizzly bear dies or decomposes, the matter within its body will eventually move to the decomposers, such as the mushrooms. Therefore, the mushroom contains matter that was originally part of the grizzly bear.",
    "21127": "The answer is B. \n\nIn movie titles, it is common to use quotation marks around the title to indicate that it is a specific work, such as a book, film, or song. This helps to distinguish the title from other text and makes it clear that it refers to a particular piece of media. Therefore, option B, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" is the correct way to write the title of the movie. Option A, with asterisks around the title, is less commonly used and may be considered unconventional in some contexts.",
    "21151": "The answer is A. \"fan\" does not rhyme with \"tin\" or \"win.\"",
    "21156": "The answer is B. \n\nA typical car's gas tank holds around 13 gallons of gasoline. This is a common size for many vehicles and provides enough fuel to cover an average range of travel. The other options (13 cups or 13 fluid ounces) are much smaller quantities that would not be sufficient for a full tank of gas in most cars.",
    "21161": "The answer is A. The term \"draconian\" comes from the laws of Draco, an ancient Athenian lawgiver who lived around 621 BC. His laws were known for their harshness and severity, hence the term \"draconian\" to describe something that is extremely severe or harsh.",
    "21163": "The answer is C. An adult great white shark typically measures around 6 meters in length.",
    "21168": "The answer is B. Namaqua chameleon. \n\nNamaqua chameleons are native to the arid regions of southern Africa, including the Namib Desert. They have evolved to blend in with their environment by having a coloration that closely resembles the sand and rocks found in their habitat. This adaptation helps them avoid predators and allows them to remain hidden while they hunt for insects and other small prey. The flat-tail horned lizard in the image is another example of an animal adapted to be camouflaged in a sandy desert, as it has a similar coloration and texture to the surrounding sand.",
    "21172": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Tim learned to speak two languages, which directly supports the conclusion that he acquired the ability to speak two languages as a result of learning it, possibly through education or exposure to multiple languages. Option A does not provide any evidence that Tim acquired the trait; it only states a fact about his mother's language skills.",
    "21174": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine which fish was moving at a lower speed, we need to calculate the speed of each fish using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor Fish A:\n- Distance = 20 kilometers\n- Time = 5 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed of Fish A} = \\frac{20 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 4 \\text{ km/hour} \\]\n\nFor Fish B:\n- Distance = 25 kilometers\n- Time = 5 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed of Fish B} = \\frac{25 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 5 \\text{ km/hour} \\]\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Fish A: 4 km/hour\n- Fish B: 5 km/hour\n\nFish A was moving at a lower speed than Fish B. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
    "21181": "The answer is A. With the given supplies, Garrett can investigate whether the squirrels prefer sunflower seeds or walnuts by placing both types of seeds in separate feeders and observing their selection. This experiment will help him determine if there is a preference between the two types of seeds. \n\nOptions B and C cannot be investigated using the provided supplies because:\n- Option B requires multiple trees to compare, but Garrett only has one tree available.\n- Option C involves the size of the feeders, which is not mentioned as a variable in the supplies list.",

    "21198": "The answer is C. The sentence \"Give Daniel a tour of the building and then take him to Mr. Carlson's office\" is an imperative sentence because it gives a command or instruction to perform an action.",
    "21207": "The answer is B. \n\nInheritance of traits typically follows genetic patterns where certain traits are passed down from parents to offspring through their genes. If Rick's biological father has curly hair, it suggests that Rick may have inherited the gene responsible for curly hair from him. This is because traits like hair texture can be influenced by genetic factors, and if one parent has a particular trait, there is a higher likelihood that their offspring will inherit that trait as well. \n\nOption A does not provide direct evidence of inheritance since the coworker could be unrelated or have the trait due to other factors such as environmental influences or different genetic backgrounds. Option C is incorrect because it mentions brown hair instead of curly hair, which is the trait in question."
