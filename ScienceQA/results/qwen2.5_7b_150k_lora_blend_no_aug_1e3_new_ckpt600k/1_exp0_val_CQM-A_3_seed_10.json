    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, as the statement \"as quiet as a jackhammer\" implies something extremely loud, which contradicts the idea of quiet snoring.",
    "7": "The answer is B. armored catfish. \n\nThe armored catfish has a mouth that is adapted for bottom feeding, similar to the sturgeon. It has a wide, flat mouth that allows it to sift through the substrate in search of food, such as small invertebrates, plants, and detritus. This adaptation helps the armored catfish efficiently locate and consume food in the bottom layers of aquatic environments.",
    "8": "The answer is A. \n\nThe given sentence is not a complete sentence because it lacks a subject and a verb. It starts with \"During the construction of Mount Rushmore,\" which is a prepositional phrase, and then continues with an incomplete thought. To make it a complete sentence, it would need to be structured as follows:\n\n\"During the construction of Mount Rushmore, approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock was removed from the mountain to create the monument.\"\n\nThis revised version includes both a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"was removed\"), making it a complete sentence.",
    "13": "The answer is C. Wendy's test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. By measuring the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria that received extra nutrients compared to the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, Wendy can determine if the additional nutrients had a positive effect on insulin production. This will allow her to assess whether she successfully increased the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria by 20%, as she aimed to do. Options A and B are not directly related to Wendy's specific goal of increasing insulin production by 20%.",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title format for a play, as it follows standard capitalization rules for titles, with each significant word capitalized.",
    "16": "The answer is B.",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns. \n\nSince Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, she has two copies of the dominant allele H. According to the context provided, the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). Therefore, Daffodil will express the dominant trait, which is not having horns. However, since the question asks specifically about her phenotype for the horns trait, and given that she has the genotype HH, it implies that she does indeed have horns because the dominant allele H is present in both copies. Thus, the correct answer is (B) having horns.",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon. \n\nBoth the bald eagle and the New Zealand falcon have feet that are adapted for grabbing prey. The bald eagle's talons are strong and sharp, allowing it to catch and hold onto its prey, such as fish or other birds. Similarly, the New Zealand falcon has sharp talons that help it catch and hold onto its prey, such as small birds or insects. The sable, on the other hand, is a type of weasel that primarily feeds on small rodents and does not have feet adapted for grabbing prey in the same way as the bald eagle or the New Zealand falcon.",
    "36": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Mars using the given data:\n\n- Volume of Jupiter = 1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mars = 1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Jupiter's volume is compared to Mars' volume:\n\n(1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3) / (1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3) \u2248 8.79 x 10^3\n\nThis means that Jupiter's volume is approximately 8,790 times larger than Mars' volume. Since 8,790 is more than 10,000, the statement \"Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars\" is true.",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, the sentence should be completed with \"kissing\" to give the raindrops a human-like action, making the sentence more vivid and engaging:\n\n\"A light spattering of raindrops fell upon the stadium, kissing the fans' cheeks.\"",
    "52": "The answer is C. \n\nEarthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.",
    "55": "The answer is A.",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture. \n\nCape vultures are known for their hooked beaks, which are specifically adapted to tear through meat. This adaptation allows them to efficiently consume carrion, which forms a significant part of their diet. Sand martins, on the other hand, have a different type of beak that is more suited for catching insects in flight, making option A incorrect.",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" is said while observing an ancient pug that seems to sleep all day, which creates a contrast between the words spoken and the actual situation, indicating sarcasm or irony.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"the prodigal son returned home\" comes from the Bible, specifically from the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15:11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nGiven that the volume of a car's gas tank is typically much larger than 40 milliliters, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a car's gas tank.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho is farthest north among the given options.",
    "74": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option provides specific evidence that Austen has acquired the ability to build a fire, as it states that she learned this skill at summer camp. This directly supports the conclusion that Austen has developed the trait of knowing how to build a fire. Option A, while related to the same skill, does not provide direct evidence of learning or acquiring the trait; instead, it describes an outcome of being able to build a fire, such as cooking food.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft. All three objects can be described as soft: soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a soft gelatin dessert, and an apron is typically made of soft material like cotton or polyester.",

    "81": "The answer is B.",
    "82": "The answer is B.",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 41\u00b0F is a more typical temperature range for a cold, rainy day compared to 41\u00b0C, which would be significantly warmer. Cold, rainy days usually have temperatures around 40-50\u00b0F or lower, depending on the location and season.",
    "101": "The answer is B. Sour. Both limes and dill pickles are known for their sour taste.",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is not shown to be consumed by any other organism, so it is likely a producer or decomposer.",
    "113": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: The ship moved 555 kilometers west in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 555 km / 10 hours = 55.5 km/h.\n- For option B: The ship moved 95 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 95 km / 10 hours = 9.5 km/h.\n- For option C: The ship moved 460 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 460 km / 10 hours = 46 km/h.\n\nComparing these speeds:\n- Option A: 55.5 km/h\n- Option B: 9.5 km/h\n- Option C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is the one in option B, which moved at 9.5 km/h.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur.\" This is because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in a heterozygous genotype (Ff). However, since the allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f), Sasha will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which is short fur.",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. Here, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud\" and \"we gave him a bath\" are both independent clauses that express complete thoughts. Therefore, this sentence is a compound sentence. Option A is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause.",
    "124": "The answer is C.",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Rosa's father has brown eyes, indicating that he likely passed the trait of having brown eyes to Rosa through genetic inheritance. This is a common way in which traits are inherited from parents to offspring. Option A does not provide any direct evidence of genetic inheritance but rather a correlation between Rosa's eye color and her hair color, which is not necessarily related to the inheritance of the eye color trait.",
    "148": "The answer is A.",
    "150": "The answer is B.",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, thereby attempting to undermine his credibility or suitability for the position of class treasurer.",
    "160": "The answer is B.",
    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction where the acid in the vinegar reacts with the copper oxide on the surface of the penny, converting it back to copper, thus removing the tarnish. This process changes the composition of the substance, making it a chemical change.",
    "165": "The answer is B.",
    "169": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because \"import\" starts with the letter \"i,\" while the guide words start with different letters (\"i\" and \"y\"). Guide words in dictionaries are used to help locate specific words alphabetically, and they typically represent the first and last words on a given page. Since \"import\" does not fit within the range defined by \"ill\" and \"industry,\" it would be placed elsewhere in the dictionary.",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion \"Midas touch\" refers to someone who is exceptionally skilled or fortunate, often implying that they can turn anything into gold. In this context, it suggests that Tyler is successful at everything he does, as he has been able to launch a thriving business and establish a well-respected charity without any special experience or training. This implies that Tyler possesses an exceptional ability or skillset that allows him to succeed in various endeavors.",
    "178": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and one subordinate idea (the source of that information).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence. It has an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"Although presidential elections take place in early November\").\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which is a complex sentence, both options A and B qualify as complex sentences based on their structure. If you need to choose only one, either option would be correct.",

The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie. \n\nThis is because the seat of the cart is pushing up on Kylie with a force of 1,200N, while Earth's gravity is pulling down on her with a force of 600N. Since these forces are in opposite directions, they are not balanced. The difference between the upward force (1,200N) and the downward force (600N) results in an unbalanced force of 600N upwards, indicating that there is a net force acting on Kylie. This net force would cause her to accelerate upwards, consistent with the physics of motion during a roller coaster ride.",
    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.",
    "664": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since the strength of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets and the orientation of their poles, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs as long as the distance between the magnets remains constant. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "790": "The answer is A. \n\nKaeng Krachan National Park is located in western Thailand, where it experiences tropical rainforest conditions. This means that the park has year-round warm temperatures, as well as a diverse range of plant and animal species adapted to the tropical environment. Therefore, option A better describes the ecosystem of Kaeng Krachan National Park. Option B is incorrect because tropical rainforests typically do not experience cold winters.",
    "803": "The answer is B. \n\nWhen referring to the title of a TV show, it should be enclosed in quotation marks (\" \") or italicized, as shown in option B. Option A uses asterisks (*) which is typically used for emphasis or to indicate a title in certain contexts but is not the standard format for TV show titles.",
    "809": "The answer is A. \n\nThe image provided shows the feet of a black-bellied whistling duck, which are adapted for swimming. Since the question asks for an animal whose feet are also adapted for swimming, we can infer that the animal in option A, the purple gallinule, would have similar adaptations for swimming as the black-bellied whistling duck. The purple gallinule is known to be a water bird with webbed feet, which helps it swim efficiently in shallow waters. On the other hand, the lava gull, mentioned in option B, is not typically associated with swimming or aquatic environments, so its feet are likely not adapted for swimming.",

    "815": "The answer is B. \n\nBlue-footed boobies have all the bird traits listed above: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and they lay eggs with shells. Chinese alligators, on the other hand, do not have feathers or wings, and they do not lay eggs with shells; instead, they lay eggs without shells and live in underground burrows during the winter. Therefore, based on the given descriptions, only the blue-footed boobies fit all the criteria to be classified as birds.",
    "818": "The answer is C. \n\nThe information in option C, \"Pablo's scar was caused by an accident. He cut his leg when he fell off his skateboard,\" provides evidence that Pablo acquired the scar as a result of an event or incident, rather than it being a genetic trait or something he was born with. This supports the conclusion that Pablo acquired the scar due to the accident involving the skateboard.",

According to the equation for the average kinetic energy of a gas particle, \\(KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle and \\(v\\) is its speed, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher than that of the particles in Sample A due to their greater mass and higher speed. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas, Sample B will have a higher temperature.",
    "896": "The answer is B.",
    "904": "The answer is B. Joy's parents have red hair. They passed down this trait to Joy. This option directly supports the conclusion that Joy inherited the red hair trait because it indicates that both of Joy's parents possess the trait, which suggests they likely passed it on genetically. Option A does not provide genetic evidence but rather describes a behavior or hairstyle, which is unrelated to the inheritance of the trait.",

Rusting involves the oxidation of iron, while grilling involves the chemical reactions that occur when meat is cooked, such as Maillard reactions and caramelization. These processes involve the formation of new chemical compounds, making them chemical changes rather than physical ones.",
    "1051": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard involves separating iron from other materials without changing its chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are created or destroyed.\n- Sewing an apron involves manipulating fabric and thread to create a garment. While there may be some minor chemical reactions involved in the dyeing or treatment of the fabric, the primary process of sewing itself is a physical change as it does not alter the fundamental properties of the materials being used.\n\nTherefore, both activities described involve only physical changes.",

This is a physical change.\n- Knitting yarn into a scarf involves manipulating the yarn to create a specific shape and structure, but it does not involve any chemical reactions that would alter the chemical composition of the yarn. Therefore, knitting is also a physical change.\n\nNeither of these processes involves heating or cooling as a cause, nor do they result in chemical changes where new substances are formed. Thus, option B is the correct choice.",
    "2144": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B provides genetic evidence supporting the conclusion that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair. If Olivia's biological parents both have red hair and Olivia also has red hair, it suggests that Olivia may have inherited the gene for red hair from her parents. However, since the question specifically mentions straight hair, we need to look for an option that directly relates to straight hair. Option B does not mention anything about straight hair; instead, it talks about Olivia's parents' hair color and Olivia's own hair color. Therefore, there isn't enough information here to support the conclusion that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair.\n\nIf we were to consider the other options:\n- Option A is not relevant because it only mentions Olivia's neighbor's hair, which doesn't provide any genetic information about Olivia.\n- Option C is also not relevant as it talks about Olivia's mother's habit of wearing her hair in a ponytail, which again doesn't provide genetic information about Olivia inheriting the trait.\n\nThus, none of the provided options directly support the conclusion that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair. If we had more specific information about Olivia's parents or siblings with straight hair, then we could make a more informed conclusion.",

Curly hair is a characteristic that can be inherited, meaning it is determined by the genes she received from her parents. If both parents have naturally curly hair, there is a higher chance that Polly will also have naturally curly hair. However, if one parent has naturally curly hair and the other has naturally straight hair, Polly may have either curly or straight hair depending on the specific genes she inherited. In any case, the fact that Polly has naturally curly hair suggests that it is an inherited trait rather than something she acquired through environmental factors or lifestyle choices.",

In Pair 2, the magnets are also facing opposite poles to each other (S-N), so they will also attract each other. However, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be stronger. This is because the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets. Therefore, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.",
    "3417": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of a gas, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of its particles and the temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is the average speed of the particle.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (1,600 m/s). However, the masses of the particles differ:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 16 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 32 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies as follows:\n\nFor Sample A:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nNotice that the speed term is the same for both samples, so the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than in Sample A, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is higher.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Therefore, since Sample B has a higher average kinetic energy, it also has a higher temperature.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) sample A.",

Therefore, option B with the title in quotation marks is the correct way to present the title of a magazine.",
    "6017": "The answer is A. \n\nTodd can investigate whether cloth towels dry faster if they are hung in the laundry room or in the backyard using the supplies he has. This experiment would help him understand the effect of different environments on the drying process of the towels. He can set up one towel in the laundry room and another in the backyard, both under similar conditions (e.g., same initial moisture level, same time of day), and compare their drying times. This will allow him to determine if there is a significant difference in drying rates between the two locations.",
    "6021": "The answer is A. The sentence uses a metaphor to compare Scooter, the dog, to a security guard. A metaphor directly compares two things by stating that one thing is another, even though they are not alike in reality. In this case, the sentence states that Scooter is the security guard, implying that he performs the role of a security guard without actually being one.",
    "6024": "The answer is C. \n\nThis option suggests that Isaac and his biological father both have short hair, which could imply a genetic link to the trait of naturally brown hair. However, it is important to note that genetics can be complex and influenced by multiple factors, so while this might support the conclusion that Isaac inherited the trait, it would not definitively prove it. To make a more accurate determination, additional information such as the hair color of other family members or a genetic test would be needed.",

    "7723": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 because the magnets in Pair 2 are larger than the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic properties are similar. However, the size of the magnets affects the strength of the magnetic force they exert on each other. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields, resulting in a greater magnetic force between them compared to smaller magnets. Therefore, the larger magnets in Pair 2 will exert a stronger magnetic force on each other than the smaller magnets in Pair 1.",

    "7747": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Sandeep, its height relative to the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external non-conservative forces act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon did not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy must be balanced by an increase in its kinetic energy. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "7748": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Gabriel's parents had straight hair, which implies they likely inherited the trait from their own parents as well. Since straight hair is a genetic trait, it can be passed down through generations. Therefore, if Gabriel's parents had straight hair, there is a higher likelihood that Gabriel inherited the trait from them. Option B does not provide any information about the inheritance pattern or the genetic basis of the hair type, making it less supportive in determining how Gabriel inherited the trait.",

Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn the case of a penny tarnishing, the copper in the penny reacts with oxygen in the air to form copper oxide, which is the reddish-brown color we see on the surface of the penny. This is a chemical change because it involves a reaction between the copper and oxygen atoms.\n\nWhen a clay pot is fired in a hot kiln, the clay undergoes a chemical change called sintering. During sintering, the clay particles fuse together due to the heat, forming a more solid and durable material. This process also involves chemical reactions between the clay minerals and other materials present in the kiln.\n\nTherefore, both processes involve chemical changes as they result from chemical reactions rather than just physical transformations.",

By comparing the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria that received extra nutrients to the amount produced by the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, Isabella can determine if the additional nutrients had a positive effect on insulin production. This will allow her to assess whether the increased nutrient levels resulted in a 20% increase in insulin production as intended. The other options are not directly related to the specific goal of the experiment, which is to test the effect of extra nutrients on insulin production.",
    "7858": "The answer is B. \n\nIn a food chain, producers are organisms that can make their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Producers are typically plants or algae, as they use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which serves as their energy source. In this case, the diatom is a type of algae, so it can produce its own food through photosynthesis. The midge larva consumes the diatom, making the diatom a producer in this food chain.",

Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn both cases, heat is used to cook or bake the food items:\n- For baking an apple pie, the oven heats up the pie, causing the dough to rise and the filling to cook.\n- For cooking an egg, the heat from a pan or stove causes the egg white to coagulate and the yolk to set, resulting in a cooked egg.\n\nNeither of these processes involves cooling as a primary cause; rather, they rely on heating to achieve the desired outcome. Additionally, while both can be considered chemical changes due to the transformation of ingredients, they are primarily classified as physical changes because the structure of the food items is altered without changing their fundamental composition.",
    "9910": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and their size and shape. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have the same magnetic strength. Therefore, the size and shape of the magnets will determine the magnitude of the magnetic force. In Pair 1, the magnets are larger than those in Pair 2, so the magnetic force between them should be greater. However, since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, the size and shape of the magnets will be the determining factor. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",
    "9911": "The answer is B. Salem.",
    "9912": "The answer is C. 4,250 miles. \n\nThe Nile River is approximately 4,160 miles (6,690 kilometers) in length, making it the longest river in the world. The other options provided are much shorter distances, which would not accurately represent the length of the Nile River.",

    "9956": "The answer is A. Raleigh.",
    "9964": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n\nThis can be inferred because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnets in Pair 2 will experience a stronger magnetic force compared to the magnets in Pair 1.",
    "9965": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the image, the De Biesbosch National Park appears to be a wetland ecosystem, which means it has land that is covered with water during most of the year. Additionally, there are other water ecosystems visible in the background, such as lakes or rivers, indicating that the park has other water ecosystems nearby. Therefore, option A better describes the De Biesbosch National Park ecosystem. Option B does not accurately describe the ecosystem, as it mentions poor soil quality, which is not evident in the image.",
    "9968": "The answer is B. \n\nIn general, the amount of thermal energy in an object is related to its temperature. The higher the temperature of an object, the more kinetic energy its particles have, resulting in more thermal energy. Therefore, the bowl of oatmeal at 80\u00b0F has more thermal energy than the one at 70\u00b0F.",
    "9971": "The answer is B. 26 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a paintbrush is typically a small object used for painting, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than millimeters, kilometers, or meters. 26 centimeters is a reasonable length for a paintbrush, as it is shorter than most adult hands but still long enough to reach various parts of a canvas or paper.",
    "9972": "The answer is C. Patrick can trade his tomatoes for Isabelle's broccoli.\n\nBased on the images provided, Patrick wants broccoli in his lunch while Isabelle wants tomatoes.

It could potentially refer to either the citizens of Seaside or the city council members, leading to ambiguity. Option A does not have a vague pronoun reference as each pronoun (\"their\" and \"them\") clearly refers to the city council members.",
    "10007": "The answer is B. Four legs. \n\nBased on the image, we can observe that Coelodonta had four legs, as seen in the fossilized skeleton. The presence of four legs is a characteristic trait that can be observed directly from the fossil. However, it is important to note that the fossil does not provide information about the color or appearance of the animal's snout, so option A cannot be confirmed based solely on the fossil evidence.",
    "10013": "The answer is B. \n\nSentence B states a fact because it provides specific historical information about an event that occurred in the 1840s involving American fans of Charles Dickens. Sentence A, on the other hand, expresses an opinion or recommendation rather than a verifiable fact.",

    "10382": "The answer is A. Arctic wolf. \n\nArctic wolves are well-adapted to living in cold, snowy environments due to their thick fur coats that provide insulation against the harsh winter conditions. Their white fur coloration helps them blend into the snowy landscape, making it easier for them to hunt and avoid predators. This adaptation is crucial for their survival in the Arctic tundra, where food can be scarce and the environment is challenging. On the other hand, porcupines are not typically found in snowy environments, so they do not have adaptations specifically for camouflage in the snow.",
    "10383": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Neptune and Earth. According to the table, Neptune's volume is 62,530 billion km\u00b3, while Earth's volume is 1,090 billion km\u00b3. To find out how many times greater Neptune's volume is compared to Earth's, we can divide Neptune's volume by Earth's volume:\n\n62,530 / 1,090 = 57.48\n\nSince 57.48 is more than 50, the statement \"Neptune's volume is more than 50 times as great as that of Earth\" is true.",

    "10951": "The answer is B. Chloroplasts are the organelles in plant cells that contain chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for capturing light energy from the sun. This captured energy is then used by the plant to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a type of sugar) through a process called photosynthesis. \n\nChromosomes, on the other hand, are structures within the nucleus of a cell that carry genetic material (DNA). They are involved in the storage and transmission of genetic information but do not directly use energy from sunlight to make sugar. The cell membrane is a barrier that regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell, while the vacuole stores water, nutrients, and waste products within the cell. Neither of these structures is primarily responsible for using energy from sunlight to make sugar.",

Deep-sea ecosystems typically have low levels of sunlight penetration, making it difficult for plants to grow and thrive. As a result, these ecosystems rely heavily on organic matter that sinks from the surface waters, providing food for various organisms. The organisms in deep-sea ecosystems often have adaptations that allow them to survive in the low-light environment, such as bioluminescence or the ability to photosynthesize using light from other sources.\n\nIn contrast, option B is incorrect because deep-sea ecosystems do not have bright sunlight. Instead, they are characterized by low light conditions, which can make it challenging for organisms to see or navigate their surroundings. Additionally, while some organisms in deep-sea ecosystems may crawl or stick to the ground, this is not a defining characteristic of all deep-sea ecosystems. Some deep-sea organisms are adapted to swim or float in the water column, while others are sessile and attach themselves to the seafloor.",

    "16898": "The answer is B. \n\nIn titles of TV shows, it is common to use quotation marks around the title to indicate that it is a specific work or name, rather than a general term. This helps to distinguish the title from other uses of the words within the title. Therefore, option B, \"Bear in the Big Blue House,\" is the correct way to present the title of a TV show. Option A, with asterisks around the title, is less commonly used and may be considered unconventional or incorrect depending on the style guide being followed.",
    "16901": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the passage, Brandon tested the filter by measuring how quickly water moved through it. This test would show whether the filter was clogged or not, as a clogged filter would result in slower water flow. The other options are not directly related to the test described in the passage. Option A is not relevant because the passage does not mention any comparison between an inexpensive and an expensive filter. Option C is also not relevant because the test measures the water flow rate, not the amount of bacteria in the water before it was filtered.",
    "16921": "The answer is C. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are aligned such that opposite poles (N and S) are facing each other, resulting in an attractive force between them. In Pair 2, the magnets are also aligned with opposite poles facing each other, resulting in an attractive force as well. Since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same (3 inches), and all the magnets are made of the same material, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.",
    "16922": "The answer is B. Having a graying coat. \n\nSince Maverick has the heterozygous genotype Gg, he has one dominant allele (G) and one recessive allele (g). In this case, the dominant allele (G) is for having a graying coat, so Maverick will express the phenotype associated with that dominant allele, which means he will have a graying coat.",
    "16923": "The answer is A. The text uses an euphemism, where the phrase \"put their dog to sleep\" is a polite way of saying that the family decided to euthanize their dog. This is an example of using euphemisms to soften the impact of a difficult or unpleasant topic.",

    "16938": "The answer is A.",
    "16945": "The answer is A. Alliteration is the repetition of initial consonant sounds within a sentence or phrase. In this case, \"as comfortable as a bed of nails\" uses alliteration with the repeated 'b' sound. However, the entire sentence is an example of hyperbole, where the chair is described as being as comfortable as a bed of nails to emphasize its discomfort, which is an exaggeration. But since the question specifically asks for the figure of speech used in the text, the correct answer would be alliteration due to the repetition of the 'b' sound.",

    "16981": "The answer is B. Pennsylvania.",
    "16987": "The answer is A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Linda. This is because the force of gravity (600N) acting downward is less than the force of the seat pushing up (1,200N). Since the forces are not equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they are not balanced, resulting in an unbalanced force and thus a net force acting on Linda.",
    "16988": "The answer is A. Columbus.",
    "16999": "The answer is A. The thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each salmon during the cooking process. The initial temperatures of both salmon were the same, but as they were exposed to the heat from the grill, their final temperatures increased. This indicates that the surrounding heat source (the grill) transferred thermal energy to the salmon, causing them to warm up.",
    "17005": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the title of the movie is written in quotation marks, which is the standard format for book titles, movie titles, and other works of fiction.

    "18065": "The answer is A. climate.\n\nThe passage describes the climate of the Yorkshire Dales National Park in England. It mentions that the prevailing winds tend to come from the west, which is a long-term pattern of wind direction rather than a short-term description of the atmosphere at a specific place and time. This indicates that the passage is describing the climate, not the weather.",
    "18070": "The answer is B. \n\nWith the given supplies, Allie can investigate whether the basketball bounces higher on gravel compared to on grass. This is because she has access to both a brick patio (which could be considered as gravel) and a grassy lawn. She can set up her experiment by comparing the height of the ball's bounce on each surface. \n\nOption A is not possible since she does not have different sizes of basketballs. Option C is also not feasible because she does not have a dirt path available for comparison. Therefore, option B is the most suitable choice based on the available supplies.",
    "18075": "The answer is C. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four boxes contain the genotype Ff, which means that all the offspring will have one copy of the dominant allele (F) and one copy of the recessive allele (f).

This type of climate is typical of taiga ecosystems, where the ground remains frozen year-round in a condition called permafrost. While the soil may be frozen year-round, option A is not accurate as it does not describe the climate or vegetation of the Eastern Siberian Taiga. Option B is also incorrect because taiga ecosystems typically have a mix of trees and shrubs, rather than mostly small plants.",
    "18083": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"Josie shot the arrow, but she missed the target,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction \"but.\" This makes it a compound sentence because each clause can stand alone as a complete thought.\n\nOption B, \"Mrs. McGee knitted bright orange mittens for the children,\" contains only one independent clause and thus is a simple sentence.",

    "18117": "The answer is B. Maggie's parents have dark skin. They passed down this trait to Maggie. This option directly supports the conclusion that Maggie inherited the dark skin trait because it indicates that Maggie's parents, who have the trait, passed it on to her. Option A does not provide evidence of inheritance since it only mentions Maggie and her father having dark hair, without any indication of whether they inherited the trait or if it was passed down from their parents.",
    "18122": "The answer is B. The word \"cement\" would not be found between the guide words \"chain\" and \"corps\" because \"cement\" comes alphabetically after \"corps.\" Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the range of words that appear on the page.

    "18137": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases, the changes involve breaking down or combining substances to form new substances:\n\n- Shaking up salad dressing involves mixing oil and vinegar, which are immiscible liquids. When shaken, they undergo emulsification, where tiny droplets of one liquid are dispersed throughout the other, forming a stable mixture. This process is a chemical change because it involves the formation of a new substance called an emulsion.\n- Beating an egg involves breaking the eggshell and using mechanical energy to mix the yolk and white together. This process can also be considered a chemical change as it can lead to the denaturation of proteins within the egg, changing their structure and properties.\n\nTherefore, both actions result in chemical changes rather than just physical changes.",

It is a complex organic polymer that is not a pure substance and does not have a fixed crystal structure.",
    "18201": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature because it has a higher average particle speed compared to Sample B. Since the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to their average speed. Therefore, the sample with the higher average particle speed (Sample A) will have the higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.",

Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the particles in Sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy due to their greater mass. As temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, Sample B will have a higher temperature.",
    "18630": "The answer is D. 14 feet. \n\nThis is because a standard school bus in the United States typically measures around 40 feet in length, but the question asks for an estimate. Among the given options, 14 feet is the closest reasonable estimate to the actual length of a school bus.",
    "18633": "The answer is C. 300 gallons. \n\nThis is because a typical kiddie pool can hold around 300 gallons of water, which is equivalent to approximately 1,136 liters or 4,287 fluid ounces. The other options are much smaller in volume, making them unlikely estimates for a kiddie pool.",
    "18635": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four boxes contain the genotype \"ff\", which means that every rose plant produced by this cross will be homozygous recessive for the flower color gene. Therefore, the probability is 4 out of 4, or 100%.",
    "18643": "The answer is C. \n\nIn Pair 1, there is one large circular magnet and one small triangular magnet. In Pair 2, there are two small triangular magnets. Since the magnets in both pairs are made of the same material, their magnetic strength per unit volume would be similar. However, since the total volume of the magnets in Pair 1 is larger than that of Pair 2, the overall magnetic strength of Pair 1 would be greater. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 would be larger than that in Pair 2.",

    "18684": "The answer is B. 2 feet. \n\nThis is because ducks typically range in size from about 18 to 40 inches (46 to 102 cm) in length, which translates to approximately 1.5 to 3.3 feet or 18 to 39 inches. Therefore, option B (2 feet) is the most reasonable estimate among the given choices.",
    "18690": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option provides specific information about how Evan acquired the scar, indicating that it was due to an accident where he cut his arm while falling off his bicycle. This directly supports the conclusion that Evan acquired the scar as a result of an event or incident rather than it being a naturally occurring trait. Option B does not provide any information about how Evan acquired the scar; instead, it makes a general statement about the fading process of scars, which is unrelated to the acquisition of the scar itself.",
    "18691": "The answer is A. The statement \"Marcy has no school spirit\u2014she never comes to any of our football games\" uses a red herring by introducing an unrelated topic (Marcy's lack of school spirit) as a reason for her absence from football games. This distracts from the actual issue, which could be that Marcy simply doesn't like football games or has other commitments. The focus shifts away from the real cause of her absence, making it a red herring fallacy.",

    "19821": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that Mr. Russo was having a bad day because he mumbled \"This is the best day of my life\" while his car broke down on the way to an important job interview, indicating that the situation is far from ideal.",
    "19823": "The answer is C. The sentence uses the future tense because it includes the word \"will\" to indicate an action that is scheduled or expected to happen in the future.",
    "19826": "The answer is A. Teaching art can be considered both a good and a service, but in the context of the question asking whether it is a good or a service, the more common classification would be that teaching art is a service. This is because services refer to activities that provide benefits or value to others, such as education, healthcare, or counseling. Teaching art falls under the category of providing educational services to students, helping them develop their artistic skills and creativity.",
    "19829": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"he\" could refer to either Tyler or someone else who studied trigonometry, making the pronoun reference vague. Option B clearly refers to \"calculus\" as the subject that Tyler did not fully comprehend, thus avoiding any ambiguity.",

    "19835": "The answer is B. European nightjar.",
    "19839": "The answer is B. snowy owl. \n\nThe snowy owl is an arctic bird that is well-adapted to its snowy environment. It has white feathers that help it blend into the snow, making it difficult for predators and prey to spot them. This adaptation allows the snowy owl to effectively hunt for food and avoid being preyed upon by other animals. In contrast, the camel is not adapted to be camouflaged in the snow as it is typically found in desert environments where it has adaptations like thick fur and large feet to help it survive in hot and dry conditions.",
    "19847": "The answer is A. Brown pelicans have feathers, wings, a beak, and they make eggs with shells, which aligns with all the bird traits listed. Salmon, on the other hand, do not have feathers or wings, and their eggs do not have shells, so they do not fit the criteria for being classified as birds.",
    "19848": "The answer is B. The sentence \"My family lives in that white house\" uses the present tense because it describes a current state or situation that is ongoing. The verb \"lives\" indicates an action that is happening now, not in the past or future.",
    "19851": "The answer is B. In option B, \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense to describe something that is one-of-a-kind or special, as it refers to the hand-knitted romper that Danielle designed herself.

    "19873": "The answer is D. Albany.",
    "19890": "The answer is B. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them. In Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the force decreases with increasing distance, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be smaller in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.",
    "19891": "The answer is B. The euphemism \"golden years\" typically refers to the later stages of life, often associated with retirement and leisure, suggesting that Mr. Duran is old.",
    "19901": "The answer is A. Sample B has the higher temperature because the mass of each particle in Sample B is greater than the mass of each particle in Sample A, while their average particle speeds are the same. Since the average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly proportional to its mass, the particles in Sample B have more kinetic energy per particle compared to those in Sample A. As temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, Sample B has a higher temperature.",
    "19902": "The answer is A. attract.\n\nIn the image, there are two magnets with their poles facing opposite directions. One magnet has its north pole (N) facing the south pole (S) of the other magnet, while the other magnet has its south pole (S) facing the north pole (N) of the first magnet. Since opposite poles attract each other, these magnets will attract each other.",

Perfume typically contains fragrances that are designed to be noticeable and pleasant to the human sense of smell, making it the option that would likely smell the most among the three choices provided. Icicles and metal paper clips generally do not have scents associated with them.",
    "19918": "The answer is A. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases:\n- An antacid tablet reacting with water involves a chemical reaction where the antacid neutralizes stomach acid, changing its composition.\n- Acid rain weathering a marble statue involves a chemical reaction between the acidic components of rainwater and the calcium carbonate in the marble, leading to the breakdown of the stone.\n\nThese processes involve the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, making them chemical changes rather than physical changes. Heating and cooling can cause physical changes but are not relevant to the given scenarios.",
    "19919": "The answer is A. Yes, chrysotile is a mineral. The properties listed include being found in nature, solid, having a fixed crystal structure, and being a pure substance, which are characteristics of minerals. Additionally, it is not made by organisms, further supporting its classification as a mineral.",
    "19921": "The answer is A.\n\nIn the given food chain, the red fox is a tertiary consumer because it eats a secondary consumer, which is the deer mouse. The deer mouse is a primary consumer that feeds on the slender wheatgrass, making it a secondary consumer as it consumes a primary producer. The red fox then preys on the deer mouse, making it a tertiary consumer in the food chain.",
    "19931": "The answer is B. A rock is a solid.",
    "19932": "The answer is B. A house.",
    "19936": "The answer is B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Edna. \n\nTo explain further, in physics, a net force is the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object. If the forces are balanced, meaning they cancel each other out, the net force would be zero, and the object would remain at rest or move with constant velocity. However, if the forces are unbalanced, there will be a net force that causes the object to accelerate.\n\nIn this case, the force of gravity pulling down on Edna is 600N, and the force of the seat pushing up on Edna is 1,200N. Since these forces are not equal (1,200N > 600N), they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force of 1,200N - 600N = 600N upward. This net force causes Edna to experience acceleration, likely upwards towards the top of the loop, as she experiences the pull of the roller coaster cart.",
    "19939": "The answer is D. North Carolina.",

    "19954": "The answer is A. Ethos (character).\n\nThe advertisement uses the ethos appeal by presenting the Ashton-Baker Credit Union as an institution that has been protecting people's money since 1902. This establishes the credit union's credibility and trustworthiness, which is important for building confidence in their services. By highlighting their long history of protecting customers' money, the ad appeals to the audience's sense of character and reputation, rather than relying solely on logic or emotional appeals.",
    "19958": "The answer is E. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four boxes contain the genotype \"Ee\". Since the allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e), all the offspring will have curled ears. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4 or 0:4.",

    "19983": "The answer is B. attract.\n\nIn the image, there are two magnets with opposite poles facing each other. One magnet has its north pole (N) facing the south pole (S) of the other magnet, and vice versa. Since opposite poles attract each other, these magnets will attract each other.",
    "19992": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is important to use proper capitalization and punctuation. Therefore, the correct way to address someone in a letter would be \"Dear Josie,\" with a comma after the salutation. This follows standard English grammar rules and maintains a professional tone. Option B, \"dear Josie,\" omits the capitalization of the first word and the comma, making it less formal and potentially less respectful.",
    "19994": "The answer is B. \n\nThe context mentions that the feet of the jacana are adapted for walking on large, floating leaves. The image provided is of an African jacana, which supports this statement. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) purple gallinule, as it is another animal whose feet are adapted for walking on large, floating leaves.",
    "19996": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, the pronoun \"It\" in the second sentence could refer to either \"Olivia's community garden project\" or \"her community garden project.\" This creates ambiguity because it is unclear which specific project is being referred to. In contrast, option B clearly states that Olivia's community garden project is the one being discussed, eliminating any potential confusion. Therefore, option A contains a vague pronoun reference.",
    "19999": "The answer is D. Oklahoma City.",

    "20028": "The answer is D. Bison.",
    "20030": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker compared to the force between the magnets in Pair 2.",
    "20038": "The answer is A.",
    "20048": "The answer is B. \n\nKiddie pools are typically much larger than 1,145 milliliters, as that would be equivalent to only about one liter or slightly more. A standard kiddie pool can hold anywhere from 200 to 500 gallons of water, which translates to approximately 757 to 1,893 liters. Therefore, option B (1,145 liters) is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a kiddie pool compared to option A (1,145 milliliters).",
    "20055": "The answer is A. Pennsylvania.",
    "20056": "The answer is A. The helicopter has a constant velocity because it is moving directly upward at a constant speed. Velocity includes both speed and direction, so if the helicopter maintains a steady speed in a straight line, its velocity remains constant. Acceleration, on the other hand, refers to a change in velocity, which would occur if the helicopter were speeding up or slowing down, or changing direction. Since the helicopter is moving at a constant speed without any changes in direction, it does not experience acceleration.",
    "20058": "The answer is C. \n\nThis option provides evidence that Tucker learned the skill of doing tricks with a jump rope, as it indicates an external influence (his sister teaching him) that led to the acquisition of the trait.

    "20111": "The answer is A. The police department is located in column 2.",
    "20124": "The answer is B. 9 kilometers. \n\nThis is because a road that spans the length of a city would be much longer than 9 centimeters, which is an extremely short distance. A kilometer is a much more appropriate unit of measurement for such a large distance. Therefore, option B (9 kilometers) is the better estimate for the length of a road from one end of a city to the other.",

In this case, the speaker is trying to discredit Nellie by associating her with her sister, who is described as watching reality television, which may be seen as less desirable than educational programming.",
    "21114": "The answer is A. \n\nIn the food web, the grizzly bear is shown to eat the barren-ground caribou. The barren-ground caribou, in turn, consumes lichen. Lichen is also consumed by the earthworm. The earthworm is then consumed by the Arctic fox. The Arctic fox is consumed by the rough-legged hawk. The rough-legged hawk is consumed by the snowy owl. The snowy owl is consumed by the parasitic jaeger. The parasitic jaeger is consumed by the grizzly bear. Therefore, the matter from the lichen, which is consumed by the earthworm, is eventually moved to the mushroom by the grizzly bear.",
    "21127": "The answer is B. \n\nIn movie titles, it is common to use quotation marks around the title to indicate that it is a specific work, such as a book, film, or song. Therefore, the correct way to write the title of the movie \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" would be with quotation marks: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Option A uses asterisks instead of quotation marks, which is not the standard format for movie titles.",
    "21151": "The answer is A. \"fan\" does not rhyme with \"tin\" or \"win.\"",
