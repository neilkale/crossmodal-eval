    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\" Jackhammers are known for being extremely loud, so the phrase implies that Mr. Herrera's snoring is quite noisy.",
    "7": "The answer is B. armored catfish.\n\nIn the image, we can see that the sturgeon has a mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward. This adaptation allows the sturgeon to easily access and consume food at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Similarly, the armored catfish also has a mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward. This allows the armored catfish to easily access and consume food at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Therefore, option B, armored catfish, is the correct answer.\n",
    "8": "The answer is A. \n\nThis is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"to create\"), making it a complete thought or independent clause. It can be considered a run-on sentence or a dependent clause in a larger sentence, but as a standalone statement, it is a complete sentence.",
    "13": "The answer is C. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n\nWendy's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This experiment aimed to determine if increasing the nutrient supply to the bacteria would result in a 20% increase in insulin production. By comparing the insulin production levels between the two groups of bacteria, Wendy could assess whether her intervention was effective in achieving the desired outcome. Therefore, the test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. Options A and B are not directly related to the specific goal of Wendy's experiment, which was to increase insulin production by 20%.",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title of the play. In titles, words are typically capitalized, and spaces between words are kept as they appear in the original text. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.",
    "16": "The answer is B.\n\nThe passage describes the climate of Chicago, as it mentions that the city is known as \"The Windy City\" but also provides an average wind speed of about 10 miles per hour. This information gives insight into the typical weather patterns and conditions in Chicago, which is characteristic of describing the climate rather than a specific instance of weather.",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns. \n\nSince Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, she has two copies of the dominant allele H. According to the context provided, the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). Therefore, Daffodil will express the dominant phenotype, which is having horns.",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon.\n\nIn the image, we can see a bald eagle with its talons extended towards a fish in the water. This demonstrates that the eagle's feet are adapted for grabbing prey. While the question asks for an example of another animal with similar adaptations, it does not provide enough information to determine if the sable or the New Zealand falcon has feet adapted for grabbing prey. However, based on general knowledge, the New Zealand falcon is known to be a bird of prey with sharp talons used for catching and holding onto prey, making it a likely candidate for having feet adapted for grabbing prey like the bald eagle.",
    "36": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Mars using the given data:\n\n- Volume of Jupiter = 1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mars = 1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Jupiter's volume is compared to Mars' volume:\n\n(1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3) / (1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3) \u2248 8.79 x 10^3\n\nThis means that Jupiter's volume is approximately 8,790 times larger than Mars' volume. Since 8,790 is greater than 10,000, the statement \"Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars\" is true.\n",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we can say that the raindrops \"kissed\" the fans' cheeks to give them a more vivid and emotional description of the scene.",
    "52": "The answer is C. \n\nEarthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.",
    "55": "The answer is A. Yes, Lithops bromfieldii is made up of many cells. \n\nLithops bromfieldii belongs to the plant kingdom, which means it is a multicellular organism. Plants are composed of many cells that work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems. In the case of Lithops bromfieldii, each leaf-like structure is actually a single cell, but the entire plant is made up of many such cells working together to perform various functions necessary for survival, such as photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction.",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture.\n\nThe image shows a red-tailed hawk with its beak adapted to tear through meat. While the red-tailed hawk is known for its diet that includes fish, mammals, and other birds, it is not the only bird with such an adaptation. The Cape vulture, another bird of prey, also has a beak adapted to tear through meat. The Cape vulture is known for its scavenging behavior and its ability to feed on carrion, which requires a strong and sharp beak to tear through tough hides and bones. Therefore, based on the given options, the Cape vulture would be the correct answer as it shares a similar adaptation in its beak compared to the red-tailed hawk.",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" is said while observing an ancient pug that seems to sleep all day. This implies that the speaker is using irony to express that the pug is not energetic at all, despite the literal meaning of the phrase.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"the prodigal son returned home\" comes from the Bible, specifically from the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15:11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nGiven that cars typically have larger fuel tanks compared to smaller vehicles or personal devices, it would be more reasonable to estimate the volume of a car's gas tank as 40 liters rather than 40 milliliters. 40 milliliters is equivalent to approximately 4 fluid ounces, which is far too small for a car's gas tank. On the other hand, 40 liters is closer to the actual capacity of a typical car's gas tank, which can range from around 30 to 60 liters depending on the make and model of the vehicle.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho. According to the map, Idaho is located in the northern part of the United States, while Alabama, South Carolina, and Oklahoma are situated further south.",
    "74": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option provides specific context about where and how Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, indicating that it was learned rather than an innate or inherited trait. Option A only states that Austen can cook food over a fire, but does not provide any information about how she acquired this skill. Therefore, option B offers more support for the conclusion that Austen learned how to build a fire.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft. \n\nAll three objects - soccer shorts, jello, and apron - can be considered soft in nature. Soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a soft gelatin dessert, and an apron is typically made of soft material like cotton or polyester. None of these objects are bouncy or hard.",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.",
    "81": "The answer is B.",
    "82": "The answer is B. sturgeon.\n\nSturgeons are bottom feeders that have mouths adapted for feeding on the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Their mouths are typically located on the underside of their heads and point downward, allowing them to easily access food particles on the bottom. This adaptation is similar to that of the armored catfish mentioned in the context, which also has a mouth adapted for bottom feeding. On the other hand, clown triggerfish are not bottom feeders and their mouths are not adapted for feeding on the bottom of the ocean floor.",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 41\u00b0C is equivalent to approximately 106\u00b0F, which would be considered very hot rather than cold. On a cold, rainy day, the temperature is more likely to be in the range of 41\u00b0F or lower.",
    "101": "The answer is B. Sour. Both limes and dill pickles are known for their sour taste.",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is a producer as it is not being consumed by any other organism in the food web.",
    "113": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: \n  Distance = 555 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 555 km / 10 hours = 55.5 km/h\n\n- For option B:\n  Distance = 95 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 95 km / 10 hours = 9.5 km/h\n\n- For option C:\n  Distance = 460 kilometers, Time = 10 hours\n  Speed = 460 km / 10 hours = 46 km/h\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Option A: 55.5 km/h\n- Option B: 9.5 km/h\n- Option C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is the one in option B, which moved at 9.5 km/h.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur.\" This is because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in her having short fur as the dominant trait.",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. In this case, each part of the sentence expresses a complete thought:\n\n- \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud\" \n- \"we gave him a bath\"\n\nSince both parts of the sentence are independent and could be separate sentences, it forms a compound sentence. Option A is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause.",
    "124": "The answer is C. \n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are ee, meaning they will all have black eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0.",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Rosa's father has brown eyes, indicating that he likely passed the brown eye trait to Rosa through genetic inheritance. While the other option mentions Rosa's hair being the same color as her eyes, it does not provide evidence of genetic inheritance specifically related to the eye color trait. Therefore, option B provides more direct support for the conclusion that Rosa inherited the brown eye trait from her father.",
    "148": "The answer is A.",
    "150": "The answer is B. axial skeleton.",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, implying that Richard might also be involved in similar illegal activities. This is an attempt to discredit Richard based on the actions of his family member rather than on any evidence related to Richard himself.",
    "160": "The answer is B.\n\nThis passage describes the weather because it talks about the arrival of a storm with dark clouds on the first day of June. It provides specific details about the atmosphere at that particular moment in time, such as the presence of dark clouds and rain. This type of information is characteristic of a description of the weather, which refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions at a given location. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a certain area, which would be more accurately described by looking at historical data and trends rather than a single event.",

    "165": "The answer is B.\n\nThe passage describes the weather because it mentions specific conditions that occurred at a particular place and time, such as the winds blowing at 30 miles per hour in Lhasa. This is an example of short-term atmospheric conditions, which is characteristic of weather. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a certain area, which would be more accurately described by looking at historical data and trends rather than a single instance of wind speed.",
    "169": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the first and last words on a page. If a word starts with a letter that comes after the last guide word or before the first guide word, it will be placed on a different page. Since \"import\" begins with the letter \"i,\" it would be found on a page with guide words starting with \"i\" or later letters.",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion \"Midas touch\" refers to someone who is exceptionally skilled or fortunate in their endeavors, often implying that they can turn anything into gold. In this context, it suggests that Tyler is successful at all that he does, as he has managed to launch a thriving business and establish a well-respected charity without any special experience or training. This implies that Tyler possesses exceptional skills or luck in his pursuits, much like the mythical figure Midas who could turn everything he touched into gold.",
    "178": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and another idea that provides additional information or explanation (the opinion of many scholars).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence. It has an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"Although presidential elections take place in early November\"). However, since the question asks for only one correct answer, we choose option A as it is more straightforward and clearly demonstrates the structure of a complex sentence with a main idea and an additional idea providing context or explanation.",
    "206": "The answer is B. True.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Mars and Mercury. According to the table:\n\n- Volume of Mars = 160 billion km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mercury = 60 billion km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Mars' volume is compared to Mercury's:\n\nMars' volume / Mercury's volume = 160 billion km\u00b3 / 60 billion km\u00b3 \u2248 2.67\n\nSince 2.67 is greater than 3, the statement that \"the volume of Mars is more than three times as large as Mercury's\" is false. Therefore, the correct answer is A. False.",

    "257": "The answer is B. Alexandrine parakeet. \n\nBoth the scarlet macaw and the Alexandrine parakeet have strong, curved beaks that are adapted to crack open large, hard nuts. This adaptation allows them to access food sources that other birds may not be able to reach, giving them an advantage in their respective habitats. The blue rock pigeon, on the other hand, has a shorter, more pointed beak that is better suited for pecking at small seeds and insects rather than cracking large, hard nuts.",
    "258": "The answer is B. Pollination. \n\nPollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from the male part of a flower (the anther) to the female part of a flower (the stigma). This transfer of pollen is essential for fertilization, which is the fusion of sperm cells with egg cells in order to produce offspring. In the case of conifers like the one shown in the image, wind can carry the pollen from the male cones to the female cones, allowing for pollination to occur. Once the pollen lands on the female cone, it can germinate and grow into a tube that delivers sperm cells to the ovules inside the female cone, leading to fertilization and the development of seeds.",

    "721": "The answer is B. The trait of naturally dark skin is typically inherited, as it is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to offspring. While environmental factors can influence skin color to some extent, such as exposure to sunlight, the primary determinant of skin color is usually genetic.",
    "722": "The answer is A. \n\nLeather belts typically range in length from around 80 to 120 centimeters (31 to 47 inches), depending on the size of the person wearing it. Therefore, option A (75 centimeters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option B (75 meters), as 75 meters would be an extremely long belt that is unlikely to be used for everyday purposes.",
    "724": "The answer is B. Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn both cases, heat is applied to the materials involved:\n- Melting glass involves heating it until it reaches its melting point, causing the solid glass to turn into a liquid state.\n- Cooking an egg involves heating it to a specific temperature, typically around 63\u00b0C (145\u00b0F), where the egg white coagulates and the yolk becomes firm or runny depending on the desired level of doneness.\n\nNeither of these processes results in a chemical change; they are primarily physical transformations due to the application of heat. Therefore, options C and D can be eliminated. Option A is incorrect because melting glass is not a purely physical change as it involves a phase transition from solid to liquid, while cooking an egg involves a chemical reaction that causes proteins to denature. Thus, option B is the most accurate answer.",
    "725": "The answer is A. opaque. All three objects - steel beam, popcorn, and towel - are opaque, meaning they do not allow light to pass through them.",
    "727": "The answer is C. 70 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a leather belt is typically much shorter than 70 kilometers or 70 meters, as these measurements would be impractical for a belt. A standard leather belt is usually around 70-80 centimeters in length to fit comfortably around the waist.",
    "737": "The answer is A.\n\nThe passage describes the climate of Uganda, as it mentions the pattern of weather in the country, specifically that the forests are humid during April and May each year. This indicates a long-term trend in the weather patterns rather than a specific instance of weather conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is A - climate.",
    "738": "The answer is B. 75 pounds. \n\nWhile goats can vary in size, an average adult goat typically weighs between 60 to 200 pounds. Therefore, 75 pounds would be a reasonable estimate for the mass of a goat.",
    "740": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense as something that is one-of-a-kind or different from anything else. The sentence states that the Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona was unique because it had significant implications for law enforcement, implying that it was a rare occurrence with a profound effect.\n\nOption B uses \"unique\" in a different context, where it refers to the Miranda warning being specific to the United States compared to other countries. Here, \"unique\" means that the Miranda warning is distinctive or special to the U.S., but not necessarily one-of-a-kind in the traditional sense.",
    "744": "The answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, both Solution A and Solution B have the same volume of solvent (30 mL). However, the number of yellow particles in each solution is different. Solution A contains four yellow particles, while Solution B contains five yellow particles. Since the volume of the solvent is the same in both solutions, the concentration of yellow particles can be determined by dividing the number of yellow particles by the volume of the solvent. \n\nFor Solution A:\nConcentration = Number of yellow particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 4 yellow particles / 30 mL\n\nFor Solution B:\nConcentration = Number of yellow particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 5 yellow particles / 30 mL\n\nComparing the concentrations, we find that Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles than Solution A because it has more yellow particles per unit volume of solvent. Therefore, the correct answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same, as Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles compared to Solution A.",
    "745": "The answer is B. Mississippi. \n\nIn the map, Mississippi is located in the western part of the United States, while Georgia, Maine, and Vermont are situated more towards the eastern side of the country. Therefore, Mississippi is the farthest west among the given options.",

    "790": "The answer is A. \n\nKaeng Krachan National Park is located in western Thailand, where it experiences tropical rainforest conditions. This means that the park has year-round warm temperatures, as well as a diverse range of plant and animal species adapted to the tropical climate. Therefore, option A better describes the Kaeng Krachan National Park ecosystem compared to option B, which suggests cold winters, which is not typical for a tropical rainforest environment.",
    "803": "The answer is B. \n\nIn titles of TV shows, it is common to use quotation marks around the title to indicate that it is a specific work or name. This is different from the use of asterisks in option A, which is typically used for emphasis or to denote a title that is not the actual name of the show but rather a description or a tagline. Therefore, option B is the correct choice for the title of a TV show.",
    "809": "The answer is A. purple gallinule.\n\nThe image shows a close-up view of the feet of a black-bellied whistling duck, which are adapted for swimming. Since the question asks for an animal whose feet are also adapted for swimming, we can infer that the animal in option A, the purple gallinule, would have similar adaptations for swimming. The purple gallinule is known to be a water bird that lives in wetlands and marshes, and its feet are indeed adapted for swimming, with webbed toes that help it move efficiently through water. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",
    "813": "The answer is A. The leaf-curling spider does not have a backbone, while the salmon does.",
    "815": "The answer is B. \n\nBlue-footed boobies have all the bird traits mentioned: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and lay eggs with shells. Chinese alligators, on the other hand, do not have wings or a beak, and their eggs do not have shells. Therefore, only option B describes an animal that possesses all the bird traits listed.",
    "818": "The answer is C. \n\nThe information in option C, \"Pablo's scar was caused by an accident. He cut his leg when he fell off his skateboard,\" provides evidence that Pablo acquired the scar as a result of an event or incident, rather than it being a genetic trait or something he was born with. This supports the conclusion that Pablo acquired the scar due to an external factor, such as the accident involving the skateboard.",
    "821": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the phrase \"Down, down, down!\" is repeated twice, making it an example of repetition. Option B does not contain any repeated phrases or words.",
    "825": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Paul, its height relative to the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external forces other than gravity act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon does not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy is directly related to the increase in its kinetic energy due to the fall. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "829": "The answer is A. There is white ash on the ground.",
    "837": "The answer is A. \n\nThe passage describes the weather because it refers to the specific conditions observed by Manuel during a particular period (last week).

Climate, on the other hand, would refer to the long-term patterns of weather in a given area, such as average temperatures and precipitation over many years.",
    "838": "The answer is B. The circulatory system helps remove carbon dioxide waste from the body by transporting it to the lungs where it can be exhaled. It also delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells throughout the body and removes cellular waste products. While the digestive system breaks down food into small pieces, that is not a function of the circulatory system.",
    "839": "The answer is B. No.\n\nGranodiorite is not a mineral because it does not have a fixed crystal structure, which is one of the defining characteristics of minerals. Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and an ordered internal structure. Granodiorite, on the other hand, is a type of igneous rock that forms through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. It is composed of various minerals, but it does not have a single, consistent chemical composition or a fixed crystal structure throughout its entire volume. Therefore, granodiorite is classified as a rock rather than a mineral.",

Among the options provided:\n\n- Macaw: This is a bird, so it is a vertebrate.\n- Domestic pig: This is a mammal, so it is also a vertebrate.\n- Giant wood wasp: This is an insect, making it an invertebrate.\n- Tokay gecko: This is a reptile, so it is a vertebrate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C, as the giant wood wasp is an invertebrate.",
    "871": "The answer is A. The basketball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; as the amount of thermal energy increases, so does the temperature. Therefore, if one basketball has more thermal energy than the other, it will also have a higher temperature.",
    "873": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Mr. Everett cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Everett washes the car,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"and.\" This makes it a compound sentence. Option A is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause.",
    "885": "The answer is B.",
    "891": "The answer is C. Sample B has the higher temperature because it has particles with a greater mass and a higher average speed compared to Sample A. According to the equation for the average kinetic energy of a gas particle, KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is its velocity, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher than that of Sample A due to their greater mass and higher average speed. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas, Sample B will have a higher temperature than Sample A.",
    "896": "The answer is B.\n\nContext: The passage describes the average wind speed during winter months in Prague, which indicates the long-term pattern of weather conditions in that area. Therefore, it is describing the climate rather than the weather, which refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions at a specific location and time.\n",

    "914": "The answer is A. \"a cozy house\" has a more positive connotation compared to \"a small house.\" While both phrases describe houses, the term \"cozy\" evokes feelings of warmth, comfort, and homeliness, which are generally associated with positive emotions. On the other hand, the word \"small\" can be perceived as negative or limiting, depending on the context in which it is used. It may imply that the house lacks space or is not suitable for certain activities or gatherings. Therefore, \"a cozy house\" is the phrase with a more positive connotation.",
    "917": "The answer is C. Ambystoma opacum.",
    "919": "The answer is A. Flamboyant cuttlefish.\n\nFlamboyant cuttlefish have a unique ability to change their color and pattern to blend into their surroundings or to communicate with other cuttlefish. They also have specialized skin cells called chromatophores that can expand or contract to reveal different colors and patterns. This allows them to create a wide range of visual displays, including warning signals to potential predators. In contrast, impalas rely on their speed and agility to escape predators rather than using visual signals to warn them away. Therefore, the flamboyant cuttlefish's skin is better adapted as a warning sign to ward off predators compared to the impala.",
    "920": "The answer is A. \n\nDuring this time, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each pizza. As the pizzas were placed in an environment with a lower temperature than their initial temperature, they would lose heat to the surroundings through conduction, convection, and radiation. This process would cause the temperature of the pizzas to decrease until it reached equilibrium with the surrounding temperature.",

Circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself. \n\nIn this case, the statement \"President Ballard is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people\" is an example of circular reasoning. It assumes the conclusion (that President Ballard is an effective communicator) as one of the premises to support the same conclusion. This is logically flawed because it does not provide any independent evidence or reasoning to support the claim. Instead, it relies on the assumption that being able to speak with people implies effectiveness, which may not always be the case.",

Both are chemical changes.\n\nRust forming on a bicycle frame involves iron reacting with oxygen and water to form iron oxide, which is a new substance different from iron. This is a chemical change.\n\nGrilling a hamburger involves cooking the meat through heat, which can cause various chemical reactions within the meat, such as Maillard reactions, where amino acids and reducing sugars combine to form new compounds that give the meat its characteristic flavor. This is also a chemical change.\n\nTherefore, both rusting and grilling involve chemical changes.",
    "1051": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard involves separating iron from other materials without altering its chemical composition. This process is considered a physical change because no new substances are created or destroyed.\n- Sewing an apron is also a physical change. It involves manipulating fabric and thread to create a garment without changing the chemical properties of the materials involved. The process does not involve any chemical reactions that would alter the materials' inherent properties.\n\nTherefore, both activities described are examples of physical changes.",
    "1057": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the image, we can see a red balloon with air coming out of it. This indicates that the air inside the balloon is in a gaseous state. Gases are characterized by their ability to expand to fill any container they are placed in, which is evident in the case of the balloon as the air spreads out and fills the space around it. Solids, on the other hand, maintain a fixed shape and volume, while liquids take the shape of their container but have a fixed volume. Therefore, based on the visual evidence provided in the image, the air inside the balloon is a gas.",

    "1925": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of each sample, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed is the same (\\( 1400 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)). However, the masses of the particles are different:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 44 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 30 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies directly using the masses:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 44 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1400 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1400 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the speed is the same for both samples, the kinetic energy will be proportional to the mass. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B because the mass of the particles in Sample A is larger.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy, it also has a higher temperature compared to Sample B. Thus, the correct answer is (C) Sample A.",

    "2137": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nCrushing a mineral into powder involves breaking down the solid mineral into smaller pieces without changing its chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are formed; it merely alters the size and shape of the existing material.\n\nKnitting yarn into a scarf involves manipulating the fibers to create a fabric structure. This process also does not involve any chemical reactions, as the yarn remains the same substance throughout the knitting process. It is a physical change that results in a different form or arrangement of the material.\n\nNeither of these processes involves heating or cooling, nor do they result in a chemical change where new substances are created. Therefore, both activities are classified as physical changes.",
    "2144": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B provides evidence that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair because it indicates that both her biological parents have red hair, and she also has red hair. This suggests a genetic link between the parents and Olivia, supporting the conclusion that she inherited the trait from them. \n\nOptions A and C do not provide direct evidence of inheritance. Option A only states that Olivia's neighbor has straight hair, which does not necessarily indicate any genetic connection or inheritance. Option C mentions that Olivia's mother often wears her straight hair in a ponytail, but this does not provide information about the genetic basis of the trait; it could simply be a personal preference or styling choice rather than an inherited trait.",

    "2657": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of the gases, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed is the same (\\( 1600 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)). However, the masses of the particles are different:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 40 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 26 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies directly using the masses:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the speeds are the same, the kinetic energy will be proportional to the mass. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B because the mass of the particles in Sample A is larger.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher, the temperature of Sample A is also higher than that of Sample B. Thus, the correct answer is (C) sample A.",

It is one of the Windward Islands and is situated between Saint Vincent to the north and Saint Lucia to the south. Dominica is known for its lush rainforests, waterfalls, and volcanic landscapes. The country is also home to the Carib people, who are the indigenous inhabitants of the island. Dominica is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and is considered a developing country with a strong focus on sustainable development and environmental conservation.",
    "5085": "The answer is C. \n\nBased on the image, we can see that the fossil of Tripneustes has a rounded body shape. The other options, such as white spines or a reddish-orange body, cannot be observed directly from the fossil itself. Fossils provide evidence of the physical characteristics of organisms that lived in the past, but they do not preserve all details of their appearance. In this case, the fossil shows a rounded body shape, which suggests that Tripneustes had a similar body structure.",
    "5088": "The answer is E. 1:3\n\nExplanation: According to the Punnett square, there are four possible combinations of alleles for the offspring: Hh, hh, Hh, and hh. Out of these, three combinations result in offspring that have Huntington's disease (Hh or hh), while one combination results in offspring that do not have the disease (hh). Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to offspring that have Huntington's disease is 1:3.",
    "5089": "The answer is B. bilberry\n\nIn the food web provided, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow within the ecosystem. Producers are typically at the base of the food chain and are responsible for converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis. They form the foundation of the food web, providing energy for other organisms to consume.\n\nIn this case, the arrow pointing from \"bilberry\" to \"arctic fox\" indicates that the arctic fox consumes bilberry as a food source. This suggests that bilberry is a producer in this tundra ecosystem, as it provides energy for the arctic fox to survive. The barren-ground caribou, on the other hand, is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer rather than a producer.",
    "5094": "The answer is C. scratchy. \n\nAll three objects - cactus, potato sack, and velcro - share the property of being scratchy to some degree. The spines of the cactus can be sharp and uncomfortable to touch, the rough texture of the potato sack can cause irritation, and the hook-and-loop fastener of velcro can also be scratchy if not properly aligned or used with care. None of the options A (hard) or B (blue) apply to all three objects as they are not necessarily hard or blue.",

    "5107": "The answer is A. Santa Fe.",
    "5108": "The answer is A. Each cake . . . the surroundings\n\nDuring the given time period, the temperature of both cakes decreased, indicating that thermal energy was transferred from the cakes to their surroundings. This transfer of thermal energy can be attributed to the difference in temperature between the cakes and their environment. As the cakes were warmer than the surrounding air, they lost heat through conduction, convection, and radiation, resulting in a decrease in their temperature.",
    "5114": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the arrow points from the bilberry to the barren-ground caribou, indicating that the barren-ground caribou consumes the bilberry. Therefore, the barren-ground caribou contains matter that was once part of the bilberry.",
    "5130": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"terribly\" is used to describe the intensity of Zach's shivering due to the cold, which aligns with its traditional sense of describing something as extremely or severely. In option B, \"terribly\" is used to describe the steepness of the slope, which is an unconventional use of the word that deviates from its traditional meaning.",
    "5132": "The answer is C. Metal flute. \n\nMetal flutes can be quite scratchy to the touch due to their metallic surface, which can feel rough or abrasive against the skin. Bark and nylon swim shorts are generally smoother and less likely to cause scratching compared to a metal flute.",

Options B and C are not directly related to the test Caleb conducted, as they involve different aspects of the water treatment process.",
    "5149": "The answer is B. Physical change. \n\nWhen you pick up a paper clip using a magnet, there is no new substance created or destroyed; instead, the magnetic force between the magnet and the paper clip causes the paper clip to move from one location to another. This movement does not involve any chemical reactions, so it is considered a physical change.",
    "5151": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Keenan's parents have pale skin, indicating that they likely passed down the trait of pale skin to Keenan through their genes. This supports the conclusion that Keenan inherited the pale skin trait from his parents. Option A does not provide any information about the inheritance of the trait, as it only mentions that Keenan and his father both have dark hair, which is unrelated to the pale skin trait.",
    "5161": "The answer is C. \n\nWith the given supplies, Darnell can investigate the effect of different types of soil on the growth of a specific type of tomato plant. Since he has one bag of potting soil and five identical clay pots, he can use the potting soil as the control group and compare it with other types of soil by planting the same type of tomato seed in each pot. This way, he can determine which type of soil results in the most fruit production for that particular tomato variety. Options A and B cannot be investigated using the provided supplies because they require more than one type of tomato seed and/or different types of pots.",
    "5167": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the information provided, Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene, where L represents the allele for a black coat and l represents the allele for a reddish-brown coat. Since the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l), Dasher will express the dominant trait, which is a black coat. Therefore, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat.",
    "5178": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n\nThis can be inferred because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the closer magnets in Pair 2 will experience a stronger magnetic force compared to the farther magnets in Pair 1.",
    "5187": "The answer is D. Austin.",
    "5191": "The answer is A. \n\nIn dictionaries, words are arranged in alphabetical order between the guide words. Since \"path\" comes before \"polar,\" any word that falls between these two words alphabetically will be found on the same page as \"path.\" Therefore, \"plum\" would be the correct choice because it is alphabetically positioned between \"path\" and \"polar.\"",
    "5196": "The answer is D. Adele can trade her tomatoes for Billy's broccoli. This way, Adele will get the broccoli she wants, and Billy will get the tomatoes he desires.",
    "5197": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"Miguel will lend us money for the tickets if we promise to repay him by the end of the year,\" there is an independent clause (\"Miguel will lend us money for the tickets\") and a dependent clause (\"if we promise to repay him by the end of the year\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the independent clause) and one subordinate idea (the dependent clause).\n\nOption B is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause without any dependent clauses.",
    "5206": "The answer is A.",
    "5219": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"he\" could refer to either Danny or Adam, making it unclear who will be letting Susan know. This creates a vague pronoun reference. Option B clearly states that Danny will be the one to inform Susan, so there is no ambiguity in the pronoun reference.",
    "5230": "The answer is B. 5 pounds. \n\nThis is because a typical grocery bag usually contains around 5 pounds of items, such as fruits, vegetables, and other groceries. It would be too light to be considered 5 tons, which is equivalent to 2,000 pounds, and too heavy to be considered 5 ounces, which is less than one pound.",
    "5235": "The answer is B. Connecticut.",
    "5242": "The answer is A - shortage. \n\nHere's how I arrived at this conclusion:\n\n- There are 20 bunk beds available for sale.\n- 15 people want to buy one bunk bed.\n\nSince there are more bunk beds available than the number of people who want to buy them, there is an excess supply of bunk beds, which means there is a surplus. On the other hand, if there were fewer bunk beds available than the number of people who wanted to buy them, it would indicate a shortage. In this case, since there are enough bunk beds for everyone who wants to buy one, there is no shortage.",
    "5247": "The answer is B. \n\nA pipe cleaner is a solid because it has a definite shape and volume, unlike a liquid or gas that can take the shape of its container. Pipe cleaners are typically made of spun cotton or synthetic fibers that are tightly wound into a cylindrical shape, giving them their characteristic form.",
    "5250": "The answer is B. True.\n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Neptune and Uranus. According to the table, the volume of Neptune is 62,530 billion km\u00b3, while the volume of Uranus is 68,330 billion km\u00b3. \n\nNow, let's calculate 75% of the volume of Uranus:\n\n75% of 68,330 billion km\u00b3 = 0.75 * 68,330 billion km\u00b3 \u2248 51,247.5 billion km\u00b3\n\nSince the volume of Neptune (62,530 billion km\u00b3) is greater than 51,247.5 billion km\u00b3, the statement \"The volume of Neptune is less than 75% of the volume of Uranus\" is false.

    "5268": "The answer is A. \n\nIn this context, the object with the highest temperature will have the most thermal energy. Since all three options have the same mass (250 grams), the one with the highest temperature (10\u00b0C) will have the most thermal energy compared to the other two options (5\u00b0C and 9\u00b0C). Therefore, option A, the 250-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 10\u00b0C, has the most thermal energy.",
    "5283": "The answer is B. \n\nAt a lower temperature, an object will have less thermal energy compared to one with a higher temperature, assuming they have the same mass. In this case, option B has a 250-gram glass of grape juice at a temperature of 10\u00b0C, while option A has the same amount of grape juice but at a higher temperature of 15\u00b0C. Therefore, option B has less thermal energy than option A.",
    "5289": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the image, the Monongahela National Forest appears to be a dense forest with tall trees and lush greenery, suggesting that it has a temperate climate with cold, wet winters. Additionally, the presence of moss and other vegetation indicates that the soil may be rich in nutrients, supporting a diverse range of plant life. Therefore, option A better describes the Monongahela National Forest ecosystem compared to option B, which suggests that the soil is rich in nutrients but only has a few types of trees, which does not align with the image description.",
    "5290": "The answer is B.",
    "5291": "The answer is A. \n\nEcho's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait is \"not having myotonia congenita.\" Since Echo has two alleles for not having myotonia congenita (mm), her genotype is homozygous recessive. This means that she does not exhibit the trait of having myotonia congenita.",

    "5520": "The answer is A. Lace monitor. \n\nLace monitors are known to use their necks to appear larger and more intimidating to potential predators. This behavior is called \"neck puffing\" or \"neck inflation,\" and it helps them deter threats by making themselves look bigger and more dangerous. It is a common defense mechanism among many species of reptiles, including snakes like the Mozambique spitting cobra in the image. On the other hand, bearded dragons are small lizards that do not use their necks to appear large and scary to predators.",
    "5523": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the passage, Zoe's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This experiment aimed to determine whether adding more nutrients to the bacteria would result in an increased production of insulin. Therefore, the test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin as intended. Option A is not relevant because the test does not involve measuring the growth rate of the bacteria. Option C is also not relevant since the test only focused on one type of bacteria and did not compare different types of bacteria.",
    "5524": "The answer is B. \"A bullheaded employee\" has a more negative connotation because it implies that the employee is stubborn or unwilling to change their ways, which can be seen as a hindrance in a work environment. On the other hand, \"a persistent employee\" suggests that the employee is determined and continues to work hard despite challenges, which is generally viewed positively.",
    "5531": "The answer is D. 18 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a hammer is typically a small tool used in construction or woodworking, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than meters or kilometers. Millimeters are too small to accurately describe the length of a hammer, while meters and kilometers are too large. Therefore, 18 centimeters is the most appropriate estimate for the length of a hammer.",
    "5532": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the food web provided, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism.

    "5575": "The answer is A. \n\nSince the tomato plant has the homozygous genotype \"ff\" for the fruit texture gene, it means that both alleles are recessive (f). According to the given context, the allele for fuzzy fruit (f) is recessive, so the plant will express the phenotype associated with the recessive allele. Therefore, the phenotype for the fruit texture trait in this plant is fuzzy fruit.",
    "5579": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on their size, shape, and distance apart. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have similar magnetic properties. However, the size and shape of the magnets in Pair 1 are larger than those in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be stronger compared to the magnets in Pair 2. Thus, the statement \"The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs\" is false. \n\nTo determine whether the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller or larger in Pair 2, we need to consider the distance between the magnets. Since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is the same as the distance between the magnets in Pair 1, the difference in the magnitude of the magnetic force would be due to the size and shape of the magnets. As mentioned earlier, the magnets in Pair 1 are larger and have a different shape compared to the magnets in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is likely to be larger in Pair 1. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",

By comparing the distances measured in each design, Edward can identify the most suitable option that meets the requirement of keeping the concert area at least 150 meters away from the road to minimize traffic noise. However, it is important to note that the test does not provide information about whether at least 20% of the park will be shaded by trees or if the concert area is located within the desired proximity to the trees. Therefore, options A and C cannot be determined based solely on the information provided in the test results.",
    "5619": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred because the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2.

False dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist. \n\nIn Dave's statement, he is presenting only two choices (voting for the Conservative Party or voting for the Labour Party), but there could be other political parties or voting methods available. This is an example of a false dichotomy, where only two options are considered when there may be more viable alternatives.",
    "6063": "The answer is A. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms to create a paradoxical effect. In this case, \"open secret\" is an oxymoron because \"open\" implies something that is known by many people, while \"secret\" implies something that is kept hidden. The phrase suggests that although Emilio's friends know he is writing a book, he himself does not talk about it, creating a paradoxical situation where the information is both known and unknown simultaneously.",
    "6064": "The answer is A.\n\nThe passage describes the climate of the Dominican Republic.

    "6080": "The answer is A. Malayan colugo. \n\nMalayan colugos, also known as flying lemurs or flying squirrels, are arboreal mammals native to Southeast Asia. They possess a unique adaptation that allows them to glide through the air using a membrane of skin that stretches between their limbs. This membrane, called a patagium, enables the colugo to glide from tree to tree, much like a flying squirrel. The patagium is supported by elongated fingers and toes, which help to spread the membrane out and increase the surface area for gliding. This adaptation is crucial for the colugo's survival in its forested habitat, allowing it to quickly escape predators and move between trees with ease. In contrast, the Sumatran orangutan is a primate species that lives in the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. While they are highly intelligent and have a unique way of moving through the trees using their long arms and prehensile tails, they do not have any adaptations for gliding.",

    "6272": "The answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, both Solution A and Solution B have the same volume of solvent (35 mL). However, the number of green particles in each solution is different. Solution A contains 4 green particles, while Solution B contains 6 green particles. Since the volume of the solvent is the same for both solutions, the concentration of green particles can be calculated by dividing the number of green particles by the volume of the solvent. \n\nFor Solution A:\nConcentration = Number of green particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 4 green particles / 35 mL\n\nFor Solution B:\nConcentration = Number of green particles / Volume of solvent\nConcentration = 6 green particles / 35 mL\n\nComparing the concentrations, we find that Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles than Solution A because it has more green particles per unit volume of solvent. Therefore, the correct answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same, as Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles compared to Solution A.",

    "7443": "The answer is C. black racer.\n\nIn the food web, the black racer is shown to be preyed upon by the bobcat. Therefore, any matter contained within the black racer will eventually move to the bobcat as it consumes the black racer. The parasol fungus is shown to be consumed by the black racer, so any matter contained within the black racer will also eventually move to the parasol fungus.",
    "7448": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Making paper from wood involves breaking down wood fibers into pulp and then recombining them to form sheets of paper. This process includes chemical reactions that break down lignin and other components of the wood to make it suitable for paper production. Therefore, making paper from wood is a chemical change.\n- Rusting of a metal gate occurs due to oxidation, where iron in the metal reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide (rust). This is a chemical reaction, as it involves the transformation of iron into rust, which is a different substance with different properties. Thus, rusting is also a chemical change.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions, so they share the characteristic of being chemical changes.",

Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases with increasing distance between them, the magnetic force will be stronger in Pair 1 because the magnets are closer together.",
    "7747": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Sandeep, its height relative to the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external forces other than gravity act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon did not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy must be balanced by an increase in its kinetic energy. As the balloon falls, its speed increases, converting the potential energy into kinetic energy. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the balloon falls.",
    "7748": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Gabriel's parents had straight hair, which implies they likely inherited the trait from their own parents as well.

In this case, option A has a pot of spaghetti sauce at 145\u00b0F, while option B has a pot at 185\u00b0F. Therefore, the pot at 145\u00b0F (option A) has less thermal energy than the pot at 185\u00b0F (option B).",
    "8758": "The answer is A. Having thorns. \n\nThis is because in genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable characteristics or traits of an organism. In this case, the allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r). Since the plant has the heterozygous genotype Rr, it means that one allele is dominant (R) and the other is recessive (r). Because the dominant allele (R) is present, the plant will express the dominant trait, which is having thorns. Therefore, the plant's phenotype for the thorns trait is having thorns.",

For baking an apple pie, the oven heats up the pie to cook it evenly and develop its texture. Similarly, cooking an egg involves heating it to change its structure and make it edible. Neither of these processes involves cooling as a primary cause; rather, they rely on the application of heat to achieve their respective transformations.",
    "9910": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on their size, shape, and distance apart. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have similar magnetic properties. In Pair 1, there are two larger magnets with a distance of 2.75 inches between them, while in Pair 2, there is one smaller magnet and one larger magnet with the same distance of 2.75 inches between them. Since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, the size and shape of the magnets will determine the strength of the magnetic force. Larger magnets generally have a stronger magnetic field than smaller ones, so the larger magnets in Pair 1 will likely exert a stronger magnetic force on each other compared to the smaller magnet in Pair 2. However, since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",

    "10382": "The answer is A. Arctic wolf. \n\nArctic wolves are well-adapted to living in cold, snowy environments due to their thick fur coat that provides insulation against the harsh winter conditions. Their white fur coloration helps them blend into the snowy landscape, making it easier for them to hide from predators and prey. This adaptation allows them to survive in the challenging environment of the Arctic tundra. On the other hand, porcupines are not typically found in snowy environments and do not have adaptations specifically designed for camouflage in the snow.",
    "10383": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Neptune and Earth. According to the table, Neptune's volume is 62,530 billion km\u00b3, while Earth's volume is 1,090 billion km\u00b3. To find out how many times greater Neptune's volume is compared to Earth's, we can divide Neptune's volume by Earth's volume:\n\n62,530 / 1,090 = 57.48\n\nSince 57.48 is more than 50, the statement \"Neptune's volume is more than 50 times as great as that of Earth\" is true.",

    "10638": "The answer is B. Indianapolis.",
    "10643": "The answer is B. 11 liters. \n\nThis is because a large soup pot typically holds a significant amount of liquid, making it more practical to measure its volume in liters rather than milliliters. 11 milliliters would be equivalent to only about one tablespoon of liquid, which is far too small for a soup pot. On the other hand, 11 liters is a much more reasonable estimate for the volume of a large soup pot, as it can hold enough liquid to serve multiple people comfortably.",
    "10647": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"Valeria was known among her coworkers for her spartan ways\" refers to the Spartan people, who were known for their strict discipline and simplicity. This allusion comes from Greek history, as the Spartans were an ancient Greek city-state located in the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula.",
    "10652": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Elijah acquired the ability to speak two languages through learning, which directly supports the conclusion that he has this trait.

    "11276": "The answer is A. \n\nIn a dictionary, guide words are placed at the top of each page to indicate the range of words that can be found on that page. The words between the guide words are arranged in alphabetical order. Since \"oats\" comes before \"onion,\" the word that would appear on the page between these two guide words is one that starts with the letter \"o\" but comes after \"oats\" and before \"onion.\" Therefore, the word \"offer\" fits this description, as it is an appropriate word that would be found within the range of \"oats\" to \"onion\" in a dictionary.",
    "11284": "The answer is A. Carson City.",
    "11289": "The answer is B. The phrase \"turn the other cheek\" is an allusion to the biblical passage found in Matthew 5:39, where Jesus says, \"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek also.\" This allusion suggests that Major, as a cow with the homozygous genotype HH for the horns trait, will exhibit the phenotype of not having horns because the allele H (for not having horns) is dominant over the allele h (for having horns). Therefore, since Major has two copies of the dominant allele H, he will express the dominant trait, which is not having horns.",
    "11295": "The answer is B. It eats another living thing.\n\nIn the given food chain, the eastern bluebird is shown to be a consumer because it is depicted as eating the red-legged grasshopper.

    "11322": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Debbie's little brother looked a little nauseous after eating mounds of candy and then going on the dizzying rides at the state fair,\" the word \"nauseous\" is used in its traditional sense to describe a feeling of nausea or discomfort, rather than as an adjective describing something that causes nausea. Option A uses \"nauseous\" to describe the rides themselves, which is not its traditional usage.",
    "11334": "The answer is (B) blowfish. \n\nBlowfish have a unique defense mechanism that involves inflating their body with water or air, making them appear larger and more intimidating to potential predators. Additionally, they have a layer of mucus on their skin that can be toxic to predators if ingested. This combination of physical appearance and chemical defense makes the blowfish well-adapted to deter attacks from predators. On the other hand, the fantastic leaf-tailed gecko has a camouflage pattern that helps it blend in with its surroundings, making it less visible to predators rather than hurting them.",

This is not a valid form of logical reasoning.",
    "11395": "The answer is A. \n\nOption A, \"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me,\" is more formal as it uses polite language and acknowledges the effort made by the other person. Option B, \"It was super nice talking with you. Thanks for fitting me in!\" is less formal because it uses casual language and doesn't express gratitude in a polite manner.",
    "11396": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B provides direct evidence that Jayla learned how to fly a plane through instruction from a pilot, indicating that she acquired the ability to fly a plane as a result of learning it. Options A and C provide circumstantial evidence but do not directly support the conclusion that Jayla acquired the trait of knowing how to fly a plane. Option A suggests that Jayla may be an experienced pilot due to her employment in the Air Force, but it does not confirm that she learned to fly a plane. Option C indicates that Jayla has practical experience flying a plane under certain conditions, but it does not establish that she learned to fly a plane. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice as it directly supports the conclusion that Jayla acquired the trait of knowing how to fly a plane.",

By using this type of appeal, the advertisement aims to persuade the audience to make an informed decision based on the nutritional value of the product rather than relying solely on emotional or character-based factors.",
    "11467": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"travesty\" is used in its traditional sense to mean an act or event that is a perversion or mockery of something serious or important, such as undermining important issues through poor reporting. Option A uses the word \"travesty\" to describe a situation where limited coverage of the presidential debates is considered unfair or unjust, but it does not convey the traditional meaning of mocking or perverting something significant.",
    "11472": "The answer is B. \n\nThe word \"anybody\" would not be found between the guide words \"ally\" and \"ascent\" because it does not fall within the alphabetical range that these words represent. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific entries by indicating the first and last words on a page. In this case, \"ally\" comes before \"ascent,\" so any word that starts with a letter after \"ally\" but before \"ascent\" would be placed on a different page. Since \"anybody\" starts with the letter \"a,\" it would be found on a page with guide words starting with letters like \"a\" or \"b.\"",
    "11479": "The answer is B. It has warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters.\n\nThis can be inferred from the image as the forest appears to be lush and green, indicating that it receives ample rainfall throughout the year. Additionally, the presence of tall trees suggests that the forest experiences warm temperatures during the summer months, while the dense foliage and mossy ground cover indicate that the winters are cold and wet. These conditions are typical of a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem, such as the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, which is characterized by warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters.",

    "11681": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn this case, both samples have the same mass of each particle (44 u), but Sample B has a higher average particle speed (580 m/s) compared to Sample A (560 m/s). Since the mass of the particles is the same, the difference in their speeds will result in a difference in their kinetic energies.\n\nThe formula for kinetic energy is:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity or speed of the particle.\n\nSince the mass of the particles is the same in both samples, the difference in their kinetic energies will be due to the difference in their speeds. Therefore, Sample B, with the higher average particle speed, will have a higher average kinetic energy than Sample A.\n\nAs a result, Sample B has the higher temperature because the average kinetic energy of its particles is greater than that of Sample A.",

    "12138": "The answer is A. sea turtle. \n\nSea turtles are marine reptiles that are well-adapted to life in the ocean. They have flippers instead of legs, which allow them to swim efficiently through the water. The flippers are strong and flexible, enabling the sea turtle to propel itself forward with powerful strokes. Additionally, their streamlined bodies and smooth skin reduce drag, allowing them to move quickly through the water. These adaptations make the sea turtle an excellent swimmer, allowing it to hunt for food and navigate its aquatic environment effectively. In contrast, the ostrich is a terrestrial bird that is not adapted for swimming. It has long legs and a large body, which make it well-suited for running on land but not for swimming.",

    "13089": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of a gas, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of its particles and the temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its average speed.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (1,500 m/s). However, the masses of the particles differ:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 44 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 30 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in each sample using the formula above. For Sample A, the average kinetic energy will be higher because the particles have more mass, even though their speeds are the same.\n\nTherefore, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy (Sample A) also has the higher temperature.",

This allusion comes from literature, specifically from Shakespeare's work.",
    "13149": "The answer is (B) painted stork.\n\nThe image shows a great blue heron, which is a type of wading bird known for its long neck and legs. The heron uses its long neck to reach into water and grab fish, while keeping the rest of its body still to avoid scaring the fish away. This adaptation allows the heron to be an effective hunter in its wetland habitat.\n\nWhile the blue-footed booby is another type of seabird that can be found in wetland habitats, it does not have the same long neck as the great blue heron. Instead, the blue-footed booby has short legs and a shorter neck, which may make it less effective at reaching into water to grab fish. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided and the image, the correct answer is (B) painted stork, as it shares a similar adaptation with the great blue heron for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still.",
    "13155": "The answer is A. \n\nIn the image, one magnet is oriented with its north pole facing downward and its south pole facing upward. The other magnet is oriented with its south pole facing downward and its north pole facing upward.

Since conglomerate lacks these properties, it cannot be considered a mineral.",
    "13203": "The answer is A. Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait is short fur because he has the homozygous genotype ff, where f represents the recessive allele for long fur. Since the allele for long fur (f) is recessive, Toby will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which in this case is short fur.",
    "13205": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option provides specific information about how Billy acquired the scar, indicating that it was caused by an accident where he cut his arm while falling off his bicycle. This directly supports the conclusion that Billy acquired the scar as a result of an event or incident rather than being born with it or developing it over time due to other factors. Option B does not provide any information about how Billy acquired the scar, only stating a general fact about the fading process of scars.",
    "13207": "The answer is B. Sweet fruit. \n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the allele for sweet fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for sour fruit (F). Since the plant in question has the homozygous genotype ff, it means both alleles are recessive. Therefore, the plant will express the recessive trait, which is sweet fruit.",

    "13217": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the image, we can see that Magnet 1 is pushing Magnet 2. Since the force is a push, it means that the direction of the push is away from Magnet 1 towards Magnet 2. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.",
    "13220": "The answer is A. \n\nAzalea plants are known for their vibrant flowers and green leaves. The green coloration of the leaves is due to the presence of chlorophyll, a pigment that allows the plant to capture energy from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. This makes azaleas an example of a photosynthetic organism, as they use sunlight to produce their own food through the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. On the other hand, Anna's hummingbirds are animals and do not perform photosynthesis; instead, they obtain energy by consuming nectar and insects.",
    "13222": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nRust forming on a metal gate involves the oxidation of iron, which is a chemical reaction where iron combines with oxygen to form iron oxide (rust).

Therefore, the correct answer is A - climate.",
    "13278": "The answer is B. Since the donkeys are moving the carts at the same speed, it indicates that they are exerting an equal amount of force on each cart. Therefore, the cart that is pulling a heavier load (in this case, the one holding 84 pounds) will require more force to be moved at the same speed as the other cart.",
    "13282": "The answer is A. Nylon swim shorts are typically made of a synthetic material that is designed to be durable and resistant to water, making them more difficult to break or tear compared to chalk, which is a soft, powdery substance. However, it is important to note that the difficulty in breaking or tearing something can vary depending on its specific properties and how it is being used. For example, if nylon swim shorts are being stretched or pulled, they may be easier to break or tear than if they are being worn normally. Similarly, if chalk is being used as a writing tool, it may be easier to break or tear than if it is being used as a building material.",

    "13421": "The answer is A. \n\nHair color, like many physical traits, is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to offspring. Audrey's naturally red hair is an example of a trait that is inherited. This means it is likely due to specific genes that she received from her parents. Traits that are acquired, on the other hand, are developed through environmental influences or experiences during one's lifetime, such as changes in diet or exposure to certain substances. Since Audrey's hair color is described as \"naturally\" red, it suggests that this characteristic is inherent and not something she developed later in life. Therefore, the correct answer is that Audrey's naturally red hair is inherited.",

    "13881": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- A banana getting ripe involves the ripening process, which is a chemical reaction where enzymes break down starches into sugars, causing the banana to change color and texture. This is a chemical change because it involves the transformation of one substance into another.\n- Milk going sour is due to the fermentation of lactic acid by bacteria present in the milk, which is also a chemical process. This results in the production of acids that cause the milk to change its taste and consistency, indicating a chemical change.\n\nBoth scenarios involve changes that occur at the molecular level, transforming substances into different forms through chemical reactions rather than just physical transformations.",
    "13893": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases, cells using oxygen to break down sugar and burning food on a stove involve chemical reactions. When cells use oxygen to break down sugar, they undergo cellular respiration, which is a series of chemical reactions that produce energy. Similarly, when food is burned on a stove, it undergoes combustion, another chemical reaction where the food reacts with oxygen to release energy in the form of heat and light. Therefore, both processes are chemical changes.",

It measures the ability of the concrete to maintain its shape after being poured. By performing the slump test, Ann and Kiara can assess whether a new batch of concrete is firm enough to be used in their construction project. If the concrete collapses when the cone is lifted, it indicates that the batch is too wet and not firm enough, and should not be used. On the other hand, if the concrete stays in a cone shape, it suggests that the batch is firm enough and suitable for use. Therefore, the slump test helps Ann and Kiara determine the suitability of a new batch of concrete for their construction project.",
    "13942": "The answer is A. \n\nThe Kermadec Arc is a deep-sea ecosystem located in the southern Pacific Ocean. This means that it is situated at great depths where there is very little sunlight penetration.

    "14333": "The answer is A. It has mostly small plants.\n\nThe Tibetan Plateau is a tundra ecosystem, which means that it has cold temperatures year-round and very little precipitation. These conditions make it difficult for large plants to grow, so the ecosystem is dominated by small plants such as grasses, mosses, and lichens. Additionally, the high altitude of the plateau means that there is less oxygen available, which can also limit plant growth. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because tundra ecosystems typically have cold temperatures year-round, rather than warm summers and cool winters.",
    "14334": "The answer is A. \n\nThis is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"the Guadalupe Mountains National Park\") and a predicate (\"offers one of the finest examples of an ancient marine reef\"). It expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.",

He then observed the cardinals visiting these feeders during the same hour each morning and counted the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with sunflower seeds and the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with flax seeds. This setup allows Juan to compare the frequency of visits by cardinals to feeders containing sunflower seeds versus those containing flax seeds. Therefore, the question that Juan's experiment can best answer is option A: Do cardinals visit feeders containing sunflower seeds more often than feeders containing flax seeds?\n\nOption B is not directly addressed by Juan's experiment because he did not measure the amount of seeds consumed per visit or compare the total amount of seeds eaten by cardinals from different types of feeders. Instead, he focused on counting the number of visits by cardinals to each type of feeder.",
    "14359": "The answer is B. \n\nThis passage describes the climate because it refers to the long-term pattern of weather in a specific location, which is characteristic of climate. The statement \"winter is the rainiest season of the year\" indicates a consistent pattern that would be typical of the climate rather than a short-term weather event.",
    "14363": "The answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, both Solution A and Solution B have the same volume of solvent (35 mL). However, the number of purple particles in each solution is different. Solution A contains 6 purple particles, while Solution B contains 4 purple particles. Since the volume of the solvent is the same in both solutions, the concentration of the solute can be determined by comparing the number of solute particles to the volume of the solvent. In this case, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles because it has more solute particles per unit volume compared to Solution B. Therefore, the correct answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.",

    "14451": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of each sample, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and their temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its average speed.\n\nFor Sample A:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_A \\)) = 36 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_A \\)) = 1,600 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2}m_Av_A^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(36 \\text{ u})(1,600 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_B \\)) = 16 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_B \\)) = 1,500 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2}m_Bv_B^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(16 \\text{ u})(1,500 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\]\n\nNow, let's compare the average kinetic energies:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2}(36)(1,600)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2}(16)(1,500)^2 \\]\n\nSince the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, but the average speed of the particles in Sample A is also greater, it is difficult to determine the exact values without performing the calculations. However, based on the given information, we can infer that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher than that in Sample B because the product of the mass and the square of the speed is larger for Sample A.\n\nTherefore, Sample A has the higher temperature.",

Straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against.\n\nIn this case, Brett's argument is that American schools should offer foreign language classes at every level. The response to this argument is a straw man fallacy, where the person responding misrepresents Brett's position by suggesting that Brett is arguing against the value of learning English. This misrepresentation makes it easier for the responder to argue against Brett's position, as they are attacking a version of the argument that is not actually being made.",
    "14702": "The answer is B. If the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C, it would indicate that the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C. This test would help Wesley ensure that the weather station would function properly under extreme conditions, such as unusually warm weather, which is important for its intended use in the town. The test does not provide information about how well the weather station would work when it was windy, so option A is not correct.",

Please note that without an actual image of the thermometer, I cannot provide the exact temperature reading.",
    "14709": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we can say that the bus \"breathed\" hard as it made a slow ascent, giving it a human-like quality by attributing the action of breathing to the bus. This makes the sentence more vivid and engaging.",
    "14712": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., won him a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects,\" there is an independent clause (\"Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\") and a dependent clause (\"won him a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the design winning the medal) and one subordinate idea (the design being of the Lincoln Memorial). Option A is a simple sentence as it only contains one independent clause without any dependent clauses.",
    "14720": "The answer is A. False causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other. \n\nIn this case, the statement assumes that companies making huge profits must be exploiting their customers simply because they are making large profits. This is an example of false causation, as it incorrectly infers a cause-and-effect relationship between the two events (profits and exploitation) without sufficient evidence to support such a conclusion. It is possible that there are other factors contributing to the profits, or that the company is not exploiting its customers but rather providing value to them through innovative products or services. Therefore, the statement is not logically sound and relies on an incorrect assumption.",

Carrots are typically harvested by pulling them out of the ground, and the part that we eat is the root, which is the thick, orange-colored portion of the plant. The root is where the plant absorbs water and nutrients from the soil, and it is the edible part of the carrot plant that we consume as a vegetable. The stem and leaves of the carrot plant are generally discarded after harvesting, as they are not typically eaten.",
    "14936": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn this case, both samples have the same mass per particle (34 u), but Sample A has a higher average particle speed (950 m/s) compared to Sample B (790 m/s). Since the mass of the particles is the same in both samples, the difference in their average kinetic energies is solely due to the difference in their average particle speeds.\n\nAccording to the equation for kinetic energy (KE = 0.5 * m * v^2), where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity, a higher average particle speed results in a higher average kinetic energy. Therefore, Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy than Sample B.\n\nSince temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles, Sample A has a higher temperature than Sample B.",

    "17927": "The answer is A.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 36 u and the average particle speed is 1200 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 32 u and the average particle speed is also 1200 m/s. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in their average kinetic energies is due to the difference in the masses of the particles. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\nKE = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the average kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the average particle speed. Since the average particle speed is the same in both samples, the difference in the average kinetic energies is due to the difference in the masses of the particles. Therefore, Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy than Sample B because its particles have a greater mass. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles, Sample A has a higher temperature than Sample B.",

    "18168": "The answer is C. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n\nBased on the passage, Helen's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This experiment aimed to determine if increasing the amount of nutrients provided to the bacteria would result in a 20% increase in insulin production. Therefore, the test could show whether Helen successfully added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. Option A is not relevant as Helen's test only focused on one type of bacteria, and there is no mention of different types of bacteria being tested. Option B is also not relevant as the test does not involve measuring the growth rate of the bacteria; it only focuses on the insulin production levels.",
    "18174": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them. In Pair 1, the magnets are closer together than in Pair 2. Since the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is smaller, the magnetic force between them will be stronger compared to Pair 2 where the magnets are farther apart. Therefore, the statement that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 is incorrect, while the statement that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 is correct.",

    "18186": "The answer is B.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average particle speed is 1,300 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 44 u and the average particle speed is 1,200 m/s.\n\nSince both samples have the same number of particles, we can compare their average kinetic energies by multiplying the mass of each particle by the square of its average particle speed:\n\nSample A: KE = 46 u * (1,300 m/s)^2\nSample B: KE = 44 u * (1,200 m/s)^2\n\nCalculating these values, we get:\n\nSample A: KE \u2248 9.78 x 10^10 J\nSample B: KE \u2248 6.33 x 10^10 J\n\nComparing the kinetic energies, we see that Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy than Sample B.

    "18704": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B suggests that Ava acquired her ability to identify insects through learning and practice, which implies that she developed the skill over time rather than inheriting it or being born with it. This aligns with the idea that Ava is good at identifying insects, as it indicates that she has developed a specific skill through education or experience. Option A, while it may be related to Ava's interest in insects, does not directly support the conclusion that she has acquired the trait of being good at identifying insects.",
    "18709": "The answer is C. Both are caused by heating.\n\nIn both scenarios, heat is involved as a driving force:\n- Burning a marshmallow over a campfire involves the marshmallow being exposed to an open flame, which provides the heat necessary to melt and char the marshmallow.\n- An engine using gasoline to power a car also relies on heat; specifically, the heat generated during the combustion process of gasoline in the engine's cylinders converts chemical energy into mechanical energy that powers the car.\n\nNeither scenario involves cooling as a primary cause or results in a physical change alone. Instead, they both involve heating as a key component in their processes.",

    "18715": "The answer is B. If Ernest decides to join the Theater Club, giving up the chance to be in the Photography Club would be considered a cost because it means he is sacrificing the potential enjoyment and experience that he could have gained by joining the Photography Club instead. This option highlights the trade-off between the benefits of joining one club versus the other, with the cost being the missed opportunity to participate in the Photography Club.",
    "18721": "The answer is B. mineral.\n\nGraphite is a mineral because it is a naturally occurring solid with a fixed chemical composition and crystalline structure. It is composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, which gives it its characteristic dark gray color and slippery feel. While graphite can be found in nature, it is not considered a rock because rocks are aggregates of one or more minerals, and they are formed through geological processes. Graphite is a single mineral, not an aggregate of minerals, so it is classified as a mineral rather than a rock.",

    "18798": "The answer is B. If the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C, then the test would show that the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C. This is because Zach set up the test chamber to simulate unusually warm weather conditions, and by checking the accuracy of the weather station's measurements after 24 hours, he could determine whether or not the device would function properly under those conditions. The test does not provide any information about how well the weather station would work when it was windy, so option A is not correct.",
    "18800": "The answer is A. \n\nThe genotype of the summer squash plant with fuzzy leaves that has one allele for fuzzy leaves (L) and one allele for smooth leaves (l) would be Ll. This indicates that it is heterozygous for the leaf texture trait.",

Thus, the source of the allusion in the sentence is British history.",
    "18938": "The answer is B. \n\nWhen sauce burns on a stove, it undergoes a chemical change because the molecules in the sauce break down and rearrange themselves into new compounds, resulting in the formation of different substances with distinct properties. This process involves the breaking of chemical bonds and the formation of new ones, which is characteristic of a chemical change. On the other hand, a physical change would involve changes in the state or appearance of the substance without altering its fundamental composition. For example, if the sauce were to boil over and spill, that would be a physical change as the sauce would simply change its location but not its chemical makeup.",

Neither of these processes involves only physical changes or heating or cooling as the primary cause.",
    "18951": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond. \n\nThis is because the forces acting on Desmond are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. The force of gravity pulling him down is 400N, and the force of the diving board pushing him up is also 400N. Since these forces are equal and opposite, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. This means that Desmond is in equilibrium and will remain stationary unless an external force acts upon him.",
    "18952": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Paul was not born knowing how to identify different fish. He had to learn this skill\" supports the conclusion that Paul acquired the trait of being good at identifying fish. This implies that the ability to identify fish is something that Paul developed through experience or learning rather than being an innate characteristic he was born with. Option A does not provide any evidence of Paul acquiring the trait; it only states that he has pet fish, which could be related but doesn't directly indicate how he acquired the skill.",

Therefore, the total time that passed between these two events is 74 + 1 = 75 years. \n\nSince none of the given options match exactly, it seems there might be an error in the provided options or the timeline. However, based on the information given, the closest option would be (D) 157 years, which is approximately 75 years.",
    "18982": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Mixing sand and water: This is a physical change because it involves combining two substances without altering their chemical composition. The sand remains sand, and the water remains water; they simply mix together.\n- A rock heating up in a campfire: This is also a physical change. When a rock heats up, its temperature increases, but its chemical properties remain unchanged. The rock does not undergo any chemical reaction that would alter its fundamental nature.\n\nBoth scenarios involve changes in state or form but do not result in the creation or destruction of new substances, making them physical changes rather than chemical ones.",

This would be a cost associated with her decision to go as a ghost instead of a superhero. Option A describes a benefit, as it indicates that Maria gets to wear the costume she is more excited about, which aligns with her preference.",
    "19299": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Bending a paper clip involves changing its shape without altering its chemical composition or structure. This is a physical change because no new substance is formed, and the properties of the paper clip remain the same except for its shape.\n- Cracking open a peanut also involves a physical change. When you crack a peanut, you are breaking it into smaller pieces, but the chemical composition of the peanut remains unchanged. The peanut is still a peanut, just broken into smaller parts.\n\nNeither bending a paper clip nor cracking a peanut results in the formation of a new substance, so they are both classified as physical changes. Neither process involves heating or cooling, nor does either involve a chemical reaction that would result in a different type of matter being produced. Therefore, options A, C, and D can be eliminated.",

    "19704": "The answer is A. rock.\n\nCalcarenite is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate, usually in the form of small fragments of shells, coral, or other organic remains. It is not a single mineral but rather a mixture of various minerals and organic materials that have been compacted and cemented together over time. Therefore, it is classified as a rock rather than a mineral.",
    "19721": "The answer is B. Styrofoam packing peanuts are generally considered to be more difficult to break or crush compared to a glass flask. While both materials can be broken under sufficient force, styrofoam is less rigid and more compressible than glass, making it harder to shatter or crush. Glass flasks, on the other hand, are made of a brittle material that can easily break if subjected to impact or pressure. However, it is important to note that the difficulty in breaking or crushing an object also depends on the size, shape, and thickness of the object itself.",
    "19722": "The answer is A. \n\nThe Great Victoria Desert is a desert ecosystem, which means it has dry conditions with limited rainfall. Deserts typically have thin soil due to the lack of organic matter and nutrients that can be found in more fertile soils. Additionally, deserts often have fewer types of organisms compared to other ecosystems because they are harsh environments that can be difficult for many species to survive in. Therefore, option A better describes the Great Victoria Desert ecosystem as it has dry, thin soil and only a few types of organisms. Option B is incorrect because it suggests that the desert has many different types of organisms, which is not accurate given the harsh conditions of a desert ecosystem.",
    "19732": "The answer is C. \n\nIodine is a solid at room temperature. It is a dark purple-black crystalline substance that sublimes easily, meaning it changes directly from a solid to a gas without passing through a liquid phase.

    "19763": "The answer is (A) armadillo lizard. \n\nIn the image, we can see that the giant pangolin has hard scales covering much of its skin, which provides protection against predators with sharp teeth. This adaptation is similar to that of an armadillo lizard, as both animals have protective scales or armor-like features on their skin. The European robin, on the other hand, does not have any visible protective features on its skin, making it less adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth.",
    "19780": "The answer is A. An ice skate is typically much shorter than 29 kilometers, so option A (29 centimeters) would be a more accurate estimate.",
    "19785": "The answer is B. The allusion to Pinocchio's nose growing suggests that Patty might be lying or exaggerating her claim about loading the dishwasher before watching the show. This is because in the story, Pinocchio's nose grows longer whenever he tells a lie, symbolizing dishonesty. Therefore, the mother's response implies that Patty may not be telling the truth about her actions.",
    "19803": "The answer is C. 3:1\n\nExplanation: According to the Punnett square, there are four possible combinations of alleles for the offspring: MM, Mm, Mm, and mm. Since the allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m), the offspring with the MM or Mm genotypes will have myotonia congenita, while the offspring with the mm genotype will not have myotonia congenita. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita is 3:1.",

    "19839": "The answer is B. snowy owl.\n\nIn the image, we can see a ptarmigan standing on a snowy surface. The ptarmigan has white feathers that help it blend into the snowy environment, making it difficult for predators to spot them. This adaptation is called camouflage, which allows the ptarmigan to remain hidden and avoid being preyed upon.\n\nNow, let's consider the options given:\n\n(A) Camel - Camels are not typically found in snowy environments, so they would not need to adapt to camouflage in the snow. Their adaptations are more suited for desert environments where they need to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures.\n\n(B) Snowy owl - Snowy owls are native to Arctic regions and are well-adapted to living in snowy environments. They have white plumage that helps them blend into the snow, making it easier for them to hunt and avoid predators.
