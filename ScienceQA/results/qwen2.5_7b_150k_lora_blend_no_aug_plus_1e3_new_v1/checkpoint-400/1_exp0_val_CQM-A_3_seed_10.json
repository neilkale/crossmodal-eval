    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\"",
    "7": "The answer is B. Armored catfish have mouths that are adapted for bottom feeding, as they have barbels (whisker-like structures) around their mouths that help them locate food on the bottom of bodies of water. Discus, on the other hand, are freshwater fish that primarily feed on floating vegetation and small invertebrates, so their mouths are not adapted for bottom feeding.",
    "8": "The answer is A.\n\nContext: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).\nMajor is a cow from this group. Major has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.\nQuestion: Based on this information, what is Major's phenotype for the horns trait?\nOptions: (A) not having horns (B) having horns\nAnswer: The answer is B.\n\nContext: N/A\nQuestion: Which greeting is correct for a letter?\nOptions: (A) Dear Mrs. Erickson, (B) Dear mrs. erickson,\nAnswer: The answer is A.\n\nContext: The following timeline shows the approximate dates when several world religions began.

    "13": "The answer is C. Wendy's test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. By measuring the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria that received extra nutrients compared to the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, Wendy can determine if the additional nutrients had a positive effect on insulin production. This will allow her to assess whether she successfully increased the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria by 20%, as she aimed to do.\n",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title format for a play, as it follows standard capitalization rules for titles, with each significant word capitalized.",
    "16": "The answer is B.\n",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns. \n\nSince Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, she has two copies of the dominant allele H. Because the allele for having horns (h) is recessive, the presence of even one copy of the dominant allele H will result in the phenotype of having horns. Therefore, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait is having horns.",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon.\n\nNew Zealand falcons are known for their sharp talons, which they use to grab and hold onto their prey. This adaptation allows them to catch and kill small birds, insects, and even small mammals. While sables are also predators, their feet are not specifically adapted for grabbing prey in the same way that a New Zealand falcon's feet are. Instead, sables use their sharp claws to catch and hold onto their prey, but they do not have the same level of specialization as a New Zealand falcon's feet.\n",

    "55": "The answer is A. Yes, Lithops bromfieldii is made up of many cells. As a plant, it belongs to the kingdom Plantae, which consists of multicellular organisms. Plants are composed of various types of cells that work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems, allowing them to perform essential functions such as photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction. In the case of Lithops bromfieldii, each leaf is made up of many cells, and the entire plant is composed of numerous cells working together to sustain life and carry out vital processes.",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture.\n\nThe Cape vulture is a large bird of prey that is native to southern Africa. It has a hooked beak that is adapted to tearing through meat, as well as strong talons that it uses to catch and hold its prey. The Cape vulture is known for its scavenging behavior, and it often feeds on carrion, including dead animals such as deer, antelope, and even large mammals like elephants. Its diet also includes smaller animals such as insects, reptiles, and amphibians. The Cape vulture is a powerful predator and plays an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control the populations of smaller animals and by breaking down carcasses, which helps to prevent the spread of disease.\n",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" is said while observing an ancient pug that seems to sleep all day, which creates a contrast between the words spoken and the actual situation, indicating sarcasm or irony.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"the prodigal son returned home\" comes from the Bible, specifically from the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15:11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 20 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 75 to 230 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as 40 milliliters would be far too small for a car's gas tank.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho is the state that is farthest north among the given options.",
    "74": "The answer is B. Austen learned how to build a fire at summer camp. This option directly indicates that Austen acquired the ability to build a fire through learning, which supports the conclusion that the trait was learned rather than innate or developed through other means. Option A only states that Austen can cook food over a fire, which does not necessarily imply that Austen learned how to build a fire specifically.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft.\n\nAll three objects can be described as soft. Soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a soft gelatin dessert, and an apron is typically made of soft material like cotton or polyester.

    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is not shown to be consumed by any other organism, so it is not a consumer.",
    "113": "The answer is B. To determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: The ship moved 555 kilometers west in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 555 km / 10 hours = 55.5 km/h.\n- For option B: The ship moved 95 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 95 km / 10 hours = 9.5 km/h.\n- For option C: The ship moved 460 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 460 km / 10 hours = 46 km/h.\n\nComparing these speeds:\n- Option A: 55.5 km/h\n- Option B: 9.5 km/h\n- Option C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is the one in option B, which moved at 9.5 km/h.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur.\" This is because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in a heterozygous genotype (Ff). However, since the allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f), Sasha will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which is short fur.",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" This makes it a compound sentence. Option A is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause.",

    "127": "The answer is B. A bag holding 5 pounds of food requires a larger force to lift compared to a bag holding 4 pounds of food, assuming all other factors such as the weight of the bag itself remain constant. The force required to lift an object is directly proportional to its weight. Therefore, the bag with more weight will require more force to lift it at the same speed.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Rosa's father has brown eyes. He passed this trait down to Rosa\" provides evidence that Rosa inherited the brown eye trait from her father, supporting the conclusion that she has brown eyes due to genetic inheritance. Option A does not provide any information about the genetic basis of the trait, only a correlation between Rosa's hair and eyes color, which is not relevant to the inheritance of the eye color trait.",

(B) In the early morning, I drank tea by a spice stall as the Turkish bazaar came to life.\nAnswer: The answer is A.\n\nExplanation: A complex sentence contains an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. Option A contains an independent clause (\"grizzly bears can run at speeds of up to thirty miles per hour\") and a dependent clause (\"Despite their large size\"). Option B also contains an independent clause (\"I drank tea by a spice stall\") and a dependent clause (\"as the Turkish bazaar came to life\"), but it is structured differently with the dependent clause preceding the independent clause. Therefore, both options A and B are complex sentences. However, if we strictly follow the structure where the dependent clause comes after the independent clause, then option A would be considered a complex sentence while option B would be considered a compound-complex sentence due to its additional independent clause.\n",

    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "664": "The answer is B. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs. However, since the direction of the force is different (attractive vs. repulsive), we cannot say that one pair has a stronger or weaker force than the other. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 because it is an attractive force, while Pair 2 has a repulsive force.",

Both are chemical changes.\n\nRust forming on a bicycle frame involves iron reacting with oxygen and water to form iron oxide, which is a new substance different from the original iron. This is a chemical change.\n\nGrilling a hamburger involves the meat being cooked through heat, which can cause various chemical reactions such as Maillard browning, where sugars react with amino acids to produce new compounds that give the food its characteristic flavor and color. This is also a chemical change.\n\nTherefore, both rusting and grilling involve chemical changes.",
    "1051": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard involves separating iron from other materials without changing their chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are created or destroyed.\n- Sewing an apron involves manipulating fabric and thread to create a garment. While sewing can involve some minor chemical reactions (like the melting of threads), the primary change is the physical arrangement of the fabric and thread into a new form. Therefore, it is also considered a physical change.\n\nBoth activities do not involve any chemical reactions that alter the fundamental nature of the materials involved, making them both examples of physical changes.",

    "1975": "The answer is D. The country highlighted in green on the map is the Dominican Republic.\n",
    "1983": "The answer is C. 38 centimeters. \n\nThis is because caterpillars typically grow to be around 2-4 inches in length, which is equivalent to approximately 50-100 millimeters or 2-4 centimeters. Therefore, option C (38 centimeters) is the most reasonable estimate among the given choices.",
    "1984": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option indicates that Beth's parents have red hair, suggesting that they likely passed the trait for red hair to Beth through genetic inheritance. The fact that Beth's parents have red hair provides evidence supporting the conclusion that Beth inherited the trait from them. Option A does not provide any genetic or familial information that directly supports the conclusion that Beth inherited the trait; it only describes an action related to hair styling rather than a genetic trait.",
    "1986": "The answer is B. EE.\n\nExplanation: Since Bianca has brown eyes and the allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e), Bianca must have two copies of the dominant allele (EE). This means her genotype is EE, indicating that she has brown eyes due to the dominance of the brown-eye allele.",
    "1990": "The answer is B. Tiger.\n\nTigers are carnivorous animals that have sharp teeth and strong jaws, which are well-adapted for tearing through meat.

    "1991": "The answer is B. Richmond.\n",
    "1997": "The answer is A. Kelp is a primary producer in the food web, meaning it produces its own food through photosynthesis. When the orca eats the kelp bass, the matter from the kelp is transferred to the orca. The orca then becomes prey for the sea otter, and the matter from the orca is transferred to the sea otter. Finally, the bat star preys on the sea otter, and the matter from the sea otter is transferred to the bat star. Therefore, the matter from the kelp eventually moves to the bat star.\n",
    "1999": "The answer is A. Oxygen.\n\nThe text states that \"Living organisms take in and release some of these gases.\" This implies that organisms rely on the atmosphere for gases, such as oxygen, to sustain life.

Rita can investigate whether squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost by setting up one group of squash plants with seeds planted near the compost pile and another group of squash plants with seeds planted far from the compost pile. This way, she can compare the growth of the squash plants based on their proximity to the compost pile, which will help her understand the effect of compost on the growth of squash plants.",
    "2019": "The answer is B. Boston.\n",
    "2031": "The answer is B.\n\nExplanation: Bryant's test involved putting a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel and observing its behavior at 200 km per hour. This test would allow him to determine how steady the parachute was at this speed, as he was specifically interested in the movement of the parachute and its potential to swing wildly, which could damage the spacecraft. Option A is incorrect because the test did not involve a speed of 400 km per hour, only 200 km per hour. Option C is incorrect because the test did not involve damaging the spacecraft; rather, it was designed to observe the behavior of the parachute under these conditions.\n",
    "2036": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"factoid\" is used to describe information that is presented as factual but is actually false or misleading, which aligns with the traditional sense of the term.

    "2074": "The answer is C. Juneau.\n",
    "2082": "The answer is A. The sentence \"Hannah towers over her older sister\" uses the present tense because it describes a current action or state that is happening now. The verb \"towers\" indicates an ongoing action, and there is no indication of past or future time in the sentence.",
    "2083": "The answer is B.",
    "2088": "The answer is B. Apostrophe is a figure of speech where a person or thing is addressed directly as if it were present. In Lord Byron's text, \"Roll on, thou dark and deep blue Ocean\u2014roll!\" the poet is speaking to the ocean, treating it as if it were alive and capable of responding. This is an example of apostrophe.",
    "2096": "The answer is B.\n\nCameron's test showed how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour. By observing the parachute in the wind tunnel, he could determine if the vent caused the parachute to swing too much at this speed. This information would help him decide if the vent size was appropriate for the spacecraft's landing on Mars. Option A is incorrect because Cameron did not test the actual spacecraft, but rather a model of the parachute. Option C is also incorrect because Cameron only tested the parachute at 200 km per hour, not 400 km per hour.",
    "2102": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the title of the book is written with quotation marks around it, which is the standard format for book titles in most writing styles, such as APA, MLA, and Chicago. Option B uses asterisks (*) instead of quotation marks, which is not the correct formatting for book titles. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",
    "2108": "The answer is B. Hayley learned biology by reading, observing, and experimenting. This option suggests that Hayley actively engaged with the subject matter through various methods, which would likely lead to a deeper understanding and knowledge of biology.

    "2109": "The answer is B. Scaptia beyonceae.\n",
    "2115": "The answer is B. \n\nRafflesia arnoldii is a plant, and all plants have cells with a nucleus. The presence of a nucleus is one of the defining characteristics of eukaryotic cells, which include plant cells. Therefore, Rafflesia arnoldii does have cells with a nucleus.",
    "2118": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"her messiness\" is a vague pronoun reference because it is unclear whether \"her\" refers to Leah or Olivia. To avoid ambiguity, it would be clearer to specify who the pronoun \"her\" is referring to, such as \"Leah's messiness\" or \"Olivia's messiness.\" Option A does not have a vague pronoun reference since \"Olivia's messiness\" clearly identifies the subject of the pronoun \"her.\"\n",
    "2131": "The answer is A. \n\nThe sentence should read: \"The sculptor hoped that her clay would be softer than it had been the day before.\" This option uses personification by attributing human-like qualities to the clay, as if it could become softer like a person might feel after being handled or worked with.",

    "2136": "The answer is D. Madison is the capital of Wisconsin.\n",
    "2137": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Crushing a mineral into powder involves breaking down the mineral into smaller pieces without changing its fundamental composition or creating new substances. This is a physical change because it does not alter the chemical properties of the mineral.\n- Knitting yarn into a scarf involves manipulating the yarn to create a specific shape and structure, but the yarn itself remains the same material throughout the process. This is also a physical change as no new substances are created, and the chemical composition of the yarn does not change.\n\nBoth processes described involve only physical changes, as they do not result in the creation of new substances or alterations to the chemical makeup of the materials involved.",
    "2144": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B provides genetic evidence supporting the conclusion that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair. If Olivia's biological parents both have red hair and Olivia also has red hair, it suggests that Olivia may have inherited the gene for red hair from her parents. However, since the question specifically mentions straight hair, we need to look for an option that directly relates to straight hair inheritance. Option B does not provide any direct information about Olivia's hair being straight; instead, it talks about her hair color and hairstyle. Therefore, none of the given options directly support the conclusion that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair based on the provided information. \n\nIf there was additional information or context that linked Olivia's straight hair to her parents' traits, then one could make a more informed conclusion. But with the current information, none of the options can be definitively used to support the conclusion that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair.",

Option A is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause.",
    "2238": "The answer is C. Lion. \n\nLions are living things because they are animals that are capable of growth, reproduction, and respond to stimuli in their environment. Windmills, paper clips, and brick walls are non-living objects or man-made structures and do not possess these characteristics.",
    "2241": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Crushing a mineral into powder involves breaking down the solid mineral into smaller pieces without changing its chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are formed.\n- Pouring milk on oatmeal involves mixing two substances but does not create any new chemical compounds. The milk and oatmeal remain as separate substances, and the process is purely physical.\n\nNeither of these actions results in a chemical reaction that would produce new substances, so both are classified as physical changes.",

    "2352": "The answer is A. Inherited.\n\nThis is because Polly's naturally curly hair is likely due to her genetic makeup, which is passed down from her parents. Curly hair is often associated with certain genetic traits that can be inherited. If both of Polly's parents have naturally curly hair, it is more likely that she inherited the gene for curly hair from them. However, if only one parent has naturally curly hair, Polly may still have naturally curly hair due to the dominance of the curly hair gene in her case. It is important to note that hair texture can also be influenced by environmental factors such as diet, hair care, and climate, but these factors typically do not change the underlying genetic predisposition for curly hair.",
    "2359": "The answer is A. Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece because he has the homozygous genotype FF, where F is the dominant allele for a hairy fleece. Since F is dominant over f (the allele for a woolly fleece), Sage will express the dominant trait, which is a hairy fleece.",

However, option A provides a reasonable estimate based on common experience. Option B, 22 hours, is far too long for such a short physical activity.",
    "2415": "The answer is B. Thistles are a type of flowering plant covered in prickly spines. Thistle plant cells contain chloroplasts, and their flowers contain nectar that attracts birds and butterflies. This indicates that thistles are capable of photosynthesis, as they possess chloroplasts within their cells, which are essential for the process of photosynthesis. On the other hand, red sea urchins are marine animals and do not have chloroplasts or the ability to perform photosynthesis. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, thistles are the photosynthetic organism.",

    "3909": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Serengeti National Park is located in Tanzania, a country in eastern Africa. Eastern Africa experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, the area receives heavy rainfall, while during the dry season, there is little to no precipitation. This seasonal pattern affects the vegetation and wildlife in the region, as plants grow and animals migrate in response to the changing weather conditions.\n\nIn addition to the seasonal rainfall, the soil in the Serengeti National Park is generally poor in nutrients. This is due to the high temperatures and intense sunlight in the region, which cause rapid decomposition of organic matter and leaching of nutrients from the soil. As a result, the soil is often low in fertility, which can limit plant growth and affect the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, option B, \"It has a rainy season and a dry season. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients,\" better describes the Serengeti National Park ecosystem compared to option A, \"It has year-round rain. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.\"\n",

    "5523": "The answer is B. Zoe's test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. By measuring the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria that received extra nutrients compared to the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, Zoe can determine if the additional nutrients had a positive effect on insulin production. This will allow her to assess whether the bacteria were able to produce 20% more insulin as intended. The other options are not directly related to the specific goal of the experiment, which is to increase insulin production by 20% through the addition of extra nutrients.\n",
    "5524": "The answer is B. \"A bullheaded employee\" has a more negative connotation because it implies stubbornness or a lack of willingness to change one's mind or approach, which can be seen as uncooperative or resistant to feedback or suggestions. On the other hand, \"a persistent employee\" suggests someone who is determined and keeps trying, which is generally viewed positively in most work environments.",

    "5544": "The answer is B. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. According to the inverse square law, the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Therefore, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller, the magnetic force between them will be stronger compared to the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "5546": "The answer is A. \n\nIn this scenario, both objects are identical in mass and material, but they differ in temperature. The object with the lower temperature (Option A, 90\u00b0F) will have less thermal energy compared to the object with the higher temperature (Option B, 95\u00b0F). Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; as temperature increases, so does the thermal energy. Therefore, the 250-gram mug of cocoa at 90\u00b0F has less thermal energy than the one at 95\u00b0F.",
    "5549": "The answer is A. Arctic fox.\n\nAn omnivore is an organism that eats both plants and animals. In the food web shown, the Arctic fox is shown to eat both the collared lemming (an animal) and the bilberry (a plant). Therefore, the Arctic fox is an omnivore.\n",

Since all three options refer to bowls of oatmeal, we can assume that the amount of thermal energy in each bowl is proportional to its temperature. Therefore, the bowl of oatmeal at 101\u00b0F would have the least thermal energy compared to the other two options, which have higher temperatures.",
    "5556": "The answer is A. The information that supports the conclusion that Susan inherited the trait of having straight hair is that both her biological parents have red hair, and she also has red hair. This suggests a genetic link, as traits are often passed down through generations within families. \n\nOption B does not provide any genetic information; it only describes Susan's mother's habit of styling her hair. Option C is also not relevant because it refers to a neighbor, who is not related to Susan genetically.",

    "5575": "The answer is A. fuzzy fruit.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the tomato plant in question has the homozygous genotype \"ff\" for the fruit texture gene. Since the allele for fuzzy fruit (f) is recessive and the allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant, the plant with the genotype \"ff\" will express the recessive trait, which is fuzzy fruit. Therefore, its phenotype for the fruit texture trait would be fuzzy fruit.",
    "5579": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. \n\nThis can be inferred because all the magnets are made of the same material, meaning they have the same magnetic properties. Additionally, the distance between the magnets in each pair is the same, as indicated by the 4-inch measurement. Since the material and distance are constant, the only variable that could affect the magnetic force is the size and shape of the magnets. However, since the problem states that the magnets in different pairs do not affect each other, we can assume that the size and shape of the magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same, making the magnitude of the magnetic force equal in both pairs.\n",

This test would help him determine which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road, as this is one of the requirements set by the city council for the park. By comparing the distances measured in each design, Edward could identify the design that best meets the requirement of keeping the concert area at least 150 meters away from the road to minimize traffic noise. However, it is important to note that the test does not provide any information about whether at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees or if the concert area is located within 20% of the park. Therefore, options A and C cannot be determined based on the information provided in the test.\n",
    "5619": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2.

    "6419": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (S-N), which means they will attract each other. However, in Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force would be the same in both pairs. However, since the direction of the force is different (attractive vs. repulsive), the effect on the objects being attracted or repelled by the magnets would be different. Therefore, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 because the magnets are attracting each other instead of repelling each other.\n",

Since the mass of each particle in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher.\n\nHowever, since the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the temperature of the gases is determined by the average kinetic energy per particle. Therefore, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy per particle will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn this case, Sample B has the higher average kinetic energy per particle because it has heavier particles, so Sample B has the higher temperature.\n",

    "13870": "The answer is A. 3:1.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are FF or Ff. Since the allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f), all of these combinations will result in offspring with sour fruit. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with sour fruit to offspring with sweet fruit is 4:0, or 3:1 if we consider the possibility of one offspring having the genotype ff (which would result in sweet fruit).",

    "13881": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- A banana getting ripe involves the breakdown of starches into sugars, which is a chemical process.\n- Milk going sour involves the production of lactic acid as bacteria break down lactose, another chemical change.\n\nTherefore, both processes involve chemical reactions rather than just physical changes or heating/cooling effects.",
    "13893": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases, cells using oxygen to break down sugar and burning food on a stove involve chemical reactions where new substances are formed as a result of the interaction between the reactants. For example, during cellular respiration, glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy. Similarly, when food burns, it undergoes combustion, producing carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other products. These processes are fundamentally different from physical changes because they involve the formation of new molecules rather than just a change in the state or shape of matter.",

It measures the ability of the concrete to maintain its shape after being poured. By performing the slump test, Ann and Kiara can assess whether the concrete in each batch is firm enough to be used in their construction project. If the concrete collapses when the cone is lifted, it indicates that the batch is too wet and not suitable for use. On the other hand, if the concrete stays in a cone shape, it suggests that the batch is firm enough to be used. Therefore, the slump test can show if a new batch of concrete is firm enough to use, making option A the correct answer.\n",

    "14460": "The answer is A. In an animal cell, the endoplasmic reticulum helps ribosomes build proteins. \n\nThis is because the endoplasmic reticulum in animal cells serves as a network of membranes that aids in the synthesis, modification, and transport of proteins. Ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis, attach to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and translate mRNA into proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), on the other hand, is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification processes.\n\nOption B is incorrect because plant cells, not animal cells, use sunlight to make sugar through photosynthesis. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is converted into chemical energy stored in glucose.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because plant cells typically contain both a nucleus and chloroplasts. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing genetic material, while chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells that perform photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct statement.",

    "16218": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"Beth had her fifteen minutes when her video of kayaking with dolphins went viral\" refers to the phrase \"fifteen minutes of fame,\" which is an allusion to the modern concept of celebrity culture where someone becomes famous for a short period of time. This phrase was popularized by the American singer and actress Marilyn Monroe, who famously said, \"I want to be alone for just fifteen minutes.\" The term has since been used to describe the brief period of fame or attention that someone might achieve through social media or other means. Therefore, the source of the allusion is modern history.",
    "16220": "The answer is A. The fact that Henry's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes suggests that Henry may have inherited the trait of having hazel eyes from his father, as eye color can be influenced by genetic factors passed down from parents to offspring. However, it's important to note that eye color can also be influenced by environmental factors such as wearing contacts or sunglasses, so this alone does not definitively prove that Henry inherited the trait from his father.",

Among the options provided, a wood chair is generally considered to be the hardest object due to its solid structure and typically being made of durable materials like wood or metal, which can provide a firm and stable surface compared to the softer and more flexible materials used in making a silk kimono or jam. However, it's important to note that the hardness of an object can also depend on its specific material properties and how it is constructed.",
    "16757": "The answer is A. Antithesis is a figure of speech where contrasting ideas are placed side by side or in close connection to emphasize their differences. In this case, \"failed\" and \"succeed\" are contrasting ideas that are placed together to highlight the potential reversal of past outcomes.",
    "16765": "The answer is B.\n\nThe magnets will attract each other because opposite poles attract. In the image, one magnet has its north pole facing the south pole of the other magnet, and vice versa. This configuration results in an attractive force between the magnets, causing them to pull together.\n",
    "16769": "The answer is A.\n",
    "16770": "The answer is E. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four squares contain the genotype FF, which means that all of the offspring will have the genotype FF. Since the allele for light yellow flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for dark yellow flowers (f), all of the offspring will have light yellow flowers. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with dark yellow flowers to offspring with light yellow flowers is 0:4.",
    "16774": "The answer is B.\n",
    "16776": "The answer is C. Sharon's scar was caused by an accident. She cut her arm when she fell off her bicycle. This option provides a specific cause for the scar, indicating that it is a new trait that Sharon acquired due to an event rather than being a genetic or familial trait.",

This literary reference makes the allusion related to literature.",
    "16819": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "16825": "The answer is B. Ff. \n\nThis means that the rose plant has one allele for light yellow flowers (F) and one allele for dark yellow flowers (f). Since the allele for light yellow flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for dark yellow flowers (f), the presence of even one F allele will result in the expression of the light yellow flower phenotype. Therefore, the plant with genotype Ff will have light yellow flowers as its phenotype.",
    "16830": "The answer is A. The colder helium balloon has less thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. In this case, since the colder balloon has lower temperatures, its particles have less kinetic energy compared to those in the hotter balloon, resulting in it having less thermal energy overall.",
    "16835": "The answer is B. The capital of Connecticut is Hartford.\n",
    "16845": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"she\" could refer to either Erica or Annie, making it a vague pronoun reference. Option A clearly identifies Erica as the one returning to the apartment and greeting Annie, so there is no ambiguity in the pronoun reference.\n",
    "16847": "The answer is A. White-spotted octopuses have tentacles, which are also called arms. They can use their tentacles to reach between corals and grab fish. Additionally, they have a soft red body with white spots, fitting the description of having a soft body and a muscular foot or tentacles, which are typical characteristics of mollusks.",
    "16856": "The answer is A. The bowling ball with less mass has less thermal energy because thermal energy is directly proportional to the mass of an object. Since both bowling balls have the same temperature, the one with less mass will contain less total thermal energy compared to the one with more mass.",
    "16860": "The answer is B. The trait of having five fingers on each hand is typically considered an inherited trait, as it is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to offspring. While there can be exceptions due to environmental factors or medical conditions, the general rule is that the number of fingers is genetically determined.",
    "16863": "The answer is B. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or opposite terms to create an effect. In this case, \"deafening silence\" is an oxymoron because \"deafening\" implies loudness while \"silence\" implies absence of sound. The juxtaposition of these two terms creates a paradoxical and striking image.\n",

    "16871": "The answer is A. 41 minutes. Lasagna typically takes around 40-45 minutes to bake in the oven, depending on the thickness of the lasagna and the specific recipe being followed. It would be unusual and impractical to bake lasagna for 41 hours, as that would result in an extremely dry and overcooked dish.",
    "16875": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass (34 u) compared to those in Sample B (20 u). Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the particles in Sample A will have a higher average kinetic energy due to their greater mass. As temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, Sample A will have a higher temperature than Sample B.\n",
    "16882": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nRebecca's naturally blond hair is an example of a trait that is typically inherited. Hair color is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to offspring. If Rebecca's parents both have naturally blond hair, it is likely that she inherited the gene responsible for her blond hair. This would be considered an inherited trait rather than an acquired one, as the color of her hair is not something she developed through environmental influences or personal choice.",
    "16888": "The answer is B. Kirk's parents have blond hair. They passed down this trait to Kirk. This option directly supports the conclusion that Kirk inherited the blond hair trait because it indicates that Kirk's parents, who both have blond hair, passed the allele responsible for blond hair to Kirk. Option A does not provide any genetic or familial information that would support the inheritance of the blond hair trait.",

Option B, while related to Vicky's interests, does not provide evidence of how she acquired her knowledge about biology.",
    "16895": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"The little boy popped a big bubble,\" it contains a subject (\"the little boy\") and a predicate (\"popped a big bubble\"), making it a complete sentence. Option A, \"We went to Texas, we saw an old fort,\" is not a complete sentence because it lacks a verb in the second part of the statement, making it a run-on sentence or a fragment.",
    "16898": "The answer is B. When referring to the title of a TV show, it should be enclosed in quotation marks (\" \") or italicized, as shown in option B: \"Bear in the Big Blue House\". Option A uses asterisks (*) which is typically used for emphasis or to indicate a title in certain contexts but is not the standard format for TV show titles.",
    "16901": "The answer is B.\n\nBased on the passage, Brandon tested the filter by measuring how quickly water moved through it. This test would show whether the filter was clogged or not, as a clogged filter would result in slower water flow. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n",
    "16921": "The answer is C. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are aligned such that opposite poles (N and S) are facing each other, resulting in an attractive force between them. In Pair 2, the magnets are also aligned with opposite poles facing each other, resulting in an attractive force between them as well. Since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same (3 inches), and all the magnets are made of the same material, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",
    "16922": "The answer is B. Having a graying coat. \n\nSince Maverick has the heterozygous genotype Gg, he has one dominant allele (G) and one recessive allele (g). In this case, the dominant allele (G) is for having a graying coat, so Maverick will express the phenotype associated with that dominant allele, which means he will have a graying coat.",
    "16923": "The answer is A. The text uses an euphemism, which is a polite or indirect way of expressing something unpleasant or sensitive. In this case, \"put their dog to sleep\" is a euphemism for euthanizing the dog.",

    "16938": "The answer is A. digital device.\n\nThe speedometer in the image is an example of a digital device because it displays the speed as a specific number rather than using a continuous scale with moving hands like an analog clock.",
    "16945": "The answer is A. Alliteration is the repetition of initial consonant sounds within a sentence or phrase. In this case, \"as comfortable as a bed of nails\" uses alliteration with the repeated 'b' sound. However, the entire sentence is an example of hyperbole, where the chair is described as being as comfortable as a bed of nails to emphasize its discomfort, which is an exaggeration. But since the question asks for the figure of speech used in the text, the correct answer would be A, alliteration.",

This is because she has access to both small and large flat rocks, allowing her to compare their skipping abilities. She cannot investigate options A or C as they require different types of rocks or additional supplies that are not mentioned in the context.",
    "16975": "The answer is B. The passage describes the weather because it refers to a specific event that occurred during a particular time period (over the weekend). It mentions the current atmospheric conditions (the wind being too weak), which is characteristic of weather rather than climate, which would refer to the long-term patterns of weather in an area.",
    "16978": "The answer is B. The idiom \"a fish out of water\" suggests that someone feels uncomfortable or out of place in a situation they are not familiar with. In this case, Leo is described as feeling like a fish out of water in an unfamiliar environment, indicating that he is likely feeling out of place due to his lack of familiarity with the surroundings.",
    "16981": "The answer is B. Pennsylvania.\n",
    "16987": "The answer is A. The forces acting on Linda are unbalanced because the force of gravity (600N) pulling her downward is less than the force of the seat pushing her upward (1,200N). Since the forces are not equal in magnitude, there is a net force acting on Linda, causing her to accelerate upward as she goes through the loop.",

Option B uses asterisks (*) instead of quotation marks, which is not the standard way to denote a movie title. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",
    "17010": "The answer is C. Bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct.\n\nIn the given text, the argument suggests that since the local government is advising everyone to remove standing water from their backyards, and none of the neighbors are doing it, there is no reason why they should do it either. This is an example of the bandwagon fallacy because it assumes that because the majority of people are not taking action, it is not necessary or advisable for them to take action as well. The argument does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support the conclusion that removing standing water is unnecessary or incorrect; instead, it relies on the popularity of the neighbors' inaction to justify their own inaction.",

    "17026": "The answer is B. 2 cups. \n\nThis is because a standard small can of tomato sauce typically contains around 2 cups of liquid. Fluid ounces and gallons are less common units of measurement for food items like canned goods, so they would be less appropriate estimates in this context.",
    "17028": "The answer is B.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the average particle speed is 1,500 m/s, while in Sample B, the average particle speed is 1,400 m/s. Since the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the difference in their average particle speeds indicates that the particles in Sample A have more kinetic energy than those in Sample B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, Sample A has the higher temperature because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy.\n",

This allusion is used to describe Betty's friends' humorous reference to her as someone who keeps telling stories or explaining things endlessly, similar to how Scheherazade kept telling stories to keep herself alive.",
    "17277": "The answer is A. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Edward. This means that the forces acting on Edward (the downward pull of Earth's gravity and the upward push of the diving board) are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net force of zero. Since there is no net force, Edward remains stationary or moves at a constant velocity, depending on his initial state of motion.",
    "17288": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to give the phone a human-like action, such as \"hiding\" under the bed, rather than using a verb like \"ringing,\" which would be more literal and less personified. Therefore, option B (\"hiding\") is the correct choice to complete the sentence with personification.",
    "17290": "The answer is A. The sentence \"Attention customers: the store will be closed Monday for its annual employee training session\" is more formal because it uses the word \"Attention,\" which is typically used in formal communications to draw attention to important information.

    "18847": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nThe trait of naturally red hair is typically determined by genetic factors, meaning it is inherited. Hair color is influenced by multiple genes, and if someone has naturally red hair, it suggests that they likely inherited the genes responsible for producing red hair from their parents. This is in contrast to acquired traits, which are changes in appearance or behavior that result from environmental factors or experiences rather than genetics. Since Reggie's red hair is described as \"naturally,\" it implies that it is an inherent characteristic passed down through his family lineage, making it an inherited trait.",

Therefore, the car that was moving at the highest speed is Car A.",
    "18851": "The answer is C. The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. \n\nThis can be inferred from the fact that all the magnets are made of the same material, and the distance between the magnets in each pair is the same (40 mm). Since the material and distance are constant, the only variable affecting the magnetic force would be the orientation of the poles. In Pair 1, the opposite poles are facing each other, while in Pair 2, the like poles are facing each other. However, since the material and distance are the same, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs, regardless of the pole orientation.",

    "18947": "The answer is C. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Cooking an egg involves a chemical change where the proteins in the egg white denature due to heat, changing their structure and making them solid.\n- An antacid tablet reacting with water also involves a chemical change. When an antacid tablet dissolves in water, it releases ions that neutralize stomach acid, which is a chemical reaction.\n\nTherefore, both processes involve chemical changes rather than physical changes or being caused by heating or cooling.",
    "18951": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond. This is because the force of gravity pulling down on Desmond (400N) is exactly equal to the force of the diving board pushing up on him (400N). When these two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. This means that Desmond is in equilibrium and will remain stationary unless another force acts upon him.",
    "18952": "The answer is B. The statement \"Paul was not born knowing how to identify different fish. He had to learn this skill\" supports the conclusion that Paul acquired the trait of being good at identifying fish. This implies that the ability to identify fish is something that Paul developed through learning or experience rather than being innate or inherited. Option A does not provide evidence of Paul acquiring the trait; it only states that he has pet fish, which could be related but doesn't directly indicate how he acquired the skill of identifying fish.",

    "19785": "The answer is B. The allusion to Pinocchio's nose growing suggests that Patty might be lying or exaggerating her claim about loading the dishwasher before watching the show. This is because in the story, Pinocchio's nose grows longer whenever he tells a lie, symbolizing dishonesty. Therefore, the mother's response implies that Patty may not be telling the truth about her actions.",
    "19803": "The answer is C. 3:1.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles are equally likely. Since the allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m), any offspring that inherit at least one M allele will have myotonia congenita. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita is 3:1.\n",

    "19826": "The answer is A. Teaching art can be considered both a good and a service, but in the context of the question asking whether it is a good or a service, the more common classification would be that teaching art is a service. This is because services are typically defined as activities that provide benefits to others without necessarily creating a physical product. Teaching art provides educational benefits to students and contributes to their development, making it a service rather than a good. However, it is important to note that the distinction between goods and services can sometimes be nuanced, and the classification may depend on the specific context or perspective being considered.",
