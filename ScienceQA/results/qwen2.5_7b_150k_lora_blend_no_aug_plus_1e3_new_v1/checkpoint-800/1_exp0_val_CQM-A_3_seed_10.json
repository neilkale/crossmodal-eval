    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\" Jackhammers are known for their extremely loud noise, so saying that Mr. Herrera's snoring is as quiet as one implies that his snoring is actually quite loud.",
    "7": "The answer is B. Armored catfish. \n\nThe image shows a sturgeon with its mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward. While the question asks for an animal whose mouth is also adapted for bottom feeding, the image only provides information about the sturgeon. Therefore, we cannot determine if any other animal's mouth is adapted for bottom feeding based solely on the image provided. However, based on general knowledge, armored catfish are known to be bottom feeders and have mouths adapted for this purpose.\n",
    "8": "The answer is A.\n\nThe given statement is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"to create\"), making it a complete thought or independent clause. It describes an action that occurred during the construction of Mount Rushmore, providing context and additional information about the process. To make it a sentence fragment, it would need to be combined with another independent clause or a dependent clause to form a complete sentence.\n",
    "13": "The answer is C. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title of the play, as it follows proper capitalization rules for titles.",
    "16": "The answer is B.\n",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns.\n",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon.\n\nExplanation: The New Zealand falcon, also known as the kea, is a bird native to New Zealand. It is known for its intelligence and adaptability, and its feet are also adapted for grabbing prey. The New Zealand falcon is a carnivorous bird that preys on small mammals, reptiles, and birds. Its feet are strong and sharp, allowing it to grasp and hold onto its prey while hunting. In contrast, the sable is a mammal that is not known for its predatory behavior or foot adaptations for grabbing prey.\n",
    "36": "The answer is A.\n",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.\n",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to give the raindrops a human-like action. \"Kissing\" the fans' cheeks is a more expressive and personified way to describe the rain falling on their faces compared to simply \"landing on\" them. It adds a sense of warmth and affection to the scene, as if the rain is gently caressing the fans.",
    "52": "The answer is C. Earthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.\n",
    "55": "The answer is A.\n",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture.\n\nThe Cape vulture is a large bird of prey that is native to southern Africa. It has a hooked beak that is well-adapted for tearing through meat, as well as strong talons for grasping and holding onto its prey. The Cape vulture is known for its scavenging behavior, feeding on carrion and other dead animals, and it plays an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control the populations of larger animals like antelope and wildebeest. The sand martin, on the other hand, is a small insect-eating bird that has a slender, pointed beak that is adapted for catching insects in flight.\n",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" contradicts the observation that the pug seems to sleep all day. This creates a humorous effect by using irony to highlight the contrast between the pug's appearance and its actual behavior.\n",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence refers to the biblical story of the prodigal son, who left his father\u2019s house and squandered his inheritance, only to return home with nothing and be welcomed back by his father. This story is found in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 15, verses 11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 20 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 75 to 230 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as it is closer to the actual capacity of a car's gas tank.\n",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho is the state that is farthest north among the given options.\n",
    "74": "The answer is B. Austen learned how to build a fire at summer camp.\n\nThis option provides a specific context or event where Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, which directly supports the conclusion that she has this trait. Option A only states that Austen can cook food over a fire, but it does not provide any information about how she acquired this skill, making it less supportive of the conclusion.\n",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft.\n\nAll three objects can be described as soft. Soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a soft gelatin dessert, and an apron is typically made of soft material like cotton or polyester.\n",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.",
    "81": "The answer is B.\n",
    "82": "The answer is B. Sturgeon. \n\nSturgeons are bottom feeders that have mouths adapted to filter food from the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Their mouths are typically located on the underside of their heads and point downward, similar to the armored catfish mentioned in the context. This adaptation allows them to effectively gather food particles from the bottom substrate as they move along the riverbed or lakebed. On the other hand, clown triggerfish are not bottom feeders; instead, they primarily consume algae and small invertebrates found on coral reefs. Their mouths are adapted for this diet, with a strong jaw and teeth designed to grind up hard surfaces like coral and extract nutrients from the algae and invertebrates.\n",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F, as it is more commonly used in everyday conversation to describe temperatures, especially in countries that use the Fahrenheit scale. Additionally, 41\u00b0F is equivalent to approximately 5\u00b0C, which would be considered quite cold and typical for a cold, rainy day.\n",
    "101": "The answer is B.\n",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing towards it, indicating that it is being consumed by other organisms in the ecosystem. Therefore, the barren-ground caribou is a consumer in this food web.\n",
    "113": "The answer is B. To determine the speed of each ship, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor Ship A:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_A = \\frac{555 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 55.5 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nFor Ship B:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_B = \\frac{95 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 9.5 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nFor Ship C:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_C = \\frac{460 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 46 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Ship A: 55.5 km/h\n- Ship B: 9.5 km/h\n- Ship C: 46 km/h\n\nShip B had the lowest speed at 9.5 km/h. Therefore, the ship that was moving at the lowest speed is Ship B.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur\" because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in an expression of short fur.\n",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence, while a dependent clause cannot. Therefore, this sentence is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses that are connected by a coordinating conjunction (in this case, \"so\").\n",
    "124": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: All of the offspring in the Punnett square have the genotype ee, which means they will all have black eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0.\n",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Rosa's father has brown eyes, indicating that he likely passed the trait of having brown eyes to Rosa through genetic inheritance. This is a common way in which traits are inherited from parents to offspring. Option A does not provide any direct evidence of genetic inheritance but rather a correlation between Rosa's eye color and her hair color, which is not necessarily related to the inheritance of the eye color trait.",
    "148": "The answer is A.\n",
    "150": "The answer is B.\n",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, implying that Richard might also be involved in similar illegal activities. This is an attempt to discredit Richard based on the actions of his family member rather than on any evidence related to Richard himself.",
    "160": "The answer is B.\n",
    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction between the acid in the vinegar and the metal in the penny, which results in the removal of the tarnish. This process changes the composition of the tarnish and the penny itself, making it a chemical change.\n",
    "165": "The answer is B.\n",
    "169": "The answer is A. The word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the first and last words on a page. If a word is not between these guide words, it means the word is either before or after them alphabetically. Since \"import\" comes after \"industry,\" it would be found on a page with guide words like \"industry\" and \"injury.\"",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion \"Midas touch\" refers to someone who is exceptionally skilled or fortunate in their endeavors, often implying that they can turn anything into gold. In this context, it suggests that Tyler is successful at everything he does, as he has been able to launch a thriving business and establish a respected charity without any special experience or training. This implies that Tyler possesses an exceptional ability or talent in various aspects of life.\n",
    "178": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and another idea that provides additional information or explanation (according to many scholars).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence. It has an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"although presidential elections take place in early November\").\n\nBoth options contain complex sentences, but since you asked for only one answer, I've chosen option A as it is a complete sentence with a clear subject and predicate.\n",
    "206": "The answer is B.\n",
    "213": "The answer is C. \"Made\" does not rhyme with \"slide\" or \"ride.\"",
    "221": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use the full name with the title or honorific, followed by a comma. Therefore, \"Dear Grandpa Tim\" is the correct format. Using just \"grandpa Tim\" would be less formal and might be considered informal in a professional or formal context.\n",
    "227": "The answer is B. Alec learned how to knit in an after school program. This option provides evidence of how Alec acquired the ability to knit sweaters, indicating that he likely learned the skill through formal instruction or practice within an organized setting like an after-school program.

    "418": "The answer is A. Kenneth's test showed how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour. This is because he observed the parachute in a wind tunnel that simulated the conditions of the spacecraft traveling at 200 km per hour. By doing this, he was able to determine if the parachute would swing too much at this speed, which could potentially damage the spacecraft. The other options are incorrect because they either refer to different speeds or conditions than those tested by Kenneth, or they assume that the test would show something that it did not actually measure.\n",
    "420": "The answer is D. 3:1\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are three possible combinations of alleles in the offspring: LL, Ll, and ll. Since the allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l), the offspring with the genotype LL or Ll will have fuzzy leaves, while the offspring with the genotype ll will have smooth leaves. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves is 3:1.\n",

In option B, \"disinterested\" is used in its traditional sense, meaning impartial or unbiased. The sentence implies that the restaurant reviews may be biased due to potential payments from restaurants, but Patrick still finds them useful for finding new places to eat. This usage aligns with the traditional definition of \"disinterested\" as impartial or unbiased.\n",
    "475": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the drawing, we can see that Ichthyornis had a short tail, as indicated by the small bone structure at the end of its skeleton. There is no indication of fur in the drawing, so option A is incorrect.\n",
    "481": "The answer is B. Flood.\n\nIn the given context, the sentence \"Water builds up in a city after heavy rain\" implies that there is an excessive amount of water accumulating in the city due to rainfall. This situation is more accurately described as a flood rather than a drought. A drought refers to a prolonged period of dryness or scarcity of precipitation, which is the opposite of the scenario presented in the sentence. Therefore, option B, \"flood,\" is the correct choice that better matches the sentence.",
    "483": "The answer is B. The text uses the \"guilt by association\" fallacy because it associates Professor Chang with another researcher who was caught falsifying data, thereby attempting to discredit her based on their shared affiliation rather than any evidence specific to her work.",

This is because the force of gravity pulling down on Kylie is 600N, while the seat of the cart is pushing up on her with a force of 1,200N. Since these two forces are acting in opposite directions, they are not balanced, resulting in an unbalanced force and thus a net force on Kylie. This net force causes her to accelerate upwards, which is why she experiences a feeling of weightlessness during the loop of the roller coaster.",
    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "664": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs, just with opposite directions.\n",

While the question asks for an animal whose feet are also adapted for swimming, it does not specify that the animal must be a duck or even a bird. Therefore, we can infer that the animal with webbed feet could be any aquatic animal, such as a purple gallinule, which is known to have webbed feet and is often found in shallow water habitats similar to those of the black-bellied whistling duck. The lava gull, on the other hand, is a land bird and its feet are not adapted for swimming.\n",
    "813": "The answer is A. The leaf-curling spider does not have a backbone, while the salmon does have a backbone.",
    "815": "The answer is B. The blue-footed boobies have all the bird traits mentioned: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and lay eggs with shells. The Chinese alligators, on the other hand, do not have wings or a beak, and their eggs do not have shells, so they do not meet the criteria for being classified as birds.\n",
    "818": "The answer is C. The information that Pablo's scar was caused by an accident when he fell off his skateboard supports the conclusion that Pablo acquired the scar as a result of an event or incident rather than being a genetic trait or something he was born with. This indicates that the scar is a new trait that Pablo developed due to the accident, rather than inheriting it from his mother or having it since birth.",
    "821": "The answer is A. The poem \"Down, down, down!\" by Alice Ruth Moore uses repetition with the phrase \"Down, down, down!\" repeated three times, creating a sense of movement and rhythm. This repetition helps to emphasize the downward motion of the mermaid as she descends into the depths of the sea. On the other hand, the poem \"The Poor Old Year Died Hard\" by Matthew Arnold does not use any repetition.\n",
    "825": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Paul, its height above the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) remains constant if no external forces other than gravity act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon does not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy must be balanced by an increase in its kinetic energy. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "829": "The answer is A. There is white ash on the ground. \n\nThis can be inferred from the image as there is a large area with white ash covering the ground, indicating that it was affected by a wildfire. The presence of white ash suggests that the fire burned intensely and consumed the vegetation in the area, leaving behind the ash as a result. The other option, \"Some of the trees have green leaves,\" is not supported by the image since most of the trees appear to be dead or burnt due to the wildfire.\n",
    "837": "The answer is A. The passage describes the weather because it refers to the specific conditions observed in Manuel's location during a particular time period (last week). Weather involves short-term atmospheric conditions, while climate refers to long-term patterns of weather in a given area. Since the passage mentions cumulus clouds every day for an extended period, it is describing the weather rather than the climate.",
    "838": "The answer is B. The circulatory system helps remove carbon dioxide waste from the body by transporting it to the lungs where it can be exhaled. It also delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells throughout the body and removes cellular waste products. While the digestive system breaks down food into small pieces, that is not a function of the circulatory system.",

    "846": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"wild\" would not be found between the guide words \"well\" and \"word\" in a dictionary because it comes alphabetically after \"word\". Guide words are used to help readers locate specific entries within a dictionary by indicating the first and last words that appear on each page. If a word falls between these guide words, it means the word is not present on that particular page. In this case, since \"wild\" comes after \"word\", it would be found on a different page or pages further down the dictionary.",
    "847": "The answer is A. The scar on Reggie's left hand is an acquired trait because it is a result of an event that occurred in his life, such as an injury or surgery, rather than being determined by his genetic makeup. Inherited traits, on the other hand, are passed down from parents to offspring through their genes.",
    "855": "The answer is B. The word \"mumble\" would not be found between the guide words \"medicine\" and \"mid\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific entries by indicating the first and last words on a page. If a word is not between these guide words, it means the word is either before or after them alphabetically. Since \"mumble\" comes after \"mid,\" it would be found on a page with guide words like \"midnight\" or later.",
    "859": "The answer is B. The description of the gray tree frog matches all the traits listed for amphibians: they spend part of their lives in water and part on land, they have moist skin, and they make eggs with no shells. The African elephant does not have any of these traits, so it cannot be classified as an amphibian.\n",

    "885": "The answer is B.\n",
    "891": "The answer is C. Sample B has the higher temperature because it has particles with a greater mass and a higher average speed compared to Sample A. According to the equation for the average kinetic energy of a gas particle, KE = 1/2 mv^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is its velocity, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher than that of Sample A. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas, Sample B will have a higher temperature.\n",

    "919": "The answer is A. Flamboyant cuttlefish.\n\nFlamboyant cuttlefish have a unique ability to change their color and pattern to blend into their surroundings or to communicate with other cuttlefish. They also have specialized skin cells called chromatophores that can expand or contract to change the color of their skin. This allows them to display warning signals to potential predators, such as bright colors or patterns that indicate they are toxic or dangerous. In contrast, impalas rely on their speed and agility to escape predators rather than using warning signals through their skin.\n",
    "920": "The answer is A. During this time, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each pizza. As the pizzas were placed in a car, they were exposed to the surrounding air temperature, which was lower than their initial temperature. As a result, heat flowed from the surroundings into the pizzas, causing them to cool down. The final temperatures of both pizzas indicate that they lost thermal energy to the surroundings during the 15-minute period.\n",

    "941": "The answer is B.\n",
    "947": "The answer is B. 26 liters. \n\nKitchen sinks typically hold a significant amount of water, so a volume of 26 milliliters would be too small to be practical for a kitchen sink. On the other hand, 26 liters is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a typical kitchen sink, as it can comfortably accommodate a full load of dishes or utensils.",
    "951": "The answer is B. The sentence \"The principal announced that half of Oakville High School's graduating class had been accepted to their top-choice colleges\" is more formal because it uses the word \"announced\" instead of \"said,\" and it also includes the phrase \"half of Oakville High School's graduating class\" which is more precise and formal than simply saying \"a lot of students.\" Additionally, the use of the present tense in the second sentence (\"had been accepted\") makes it sound more official and less conversational compared to the first sentence, where the past tense is used (\"got into\").",

    "1046": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nRust forming on a bicycle frame involves iron reacting with oxygen and water to form iron oxide, which is a new substance different from iron. This is a chemical change.\n\nGrilling a hamburger involves the meat being cooked through heat, causing proteins and other compounds within the meat to break down and potentially form new substances like Maillard reaction products. This is also a chemical change.\n\nTherefore, both rusting and grilling involve chemical reactions that result in the formation of new substances, making them both chemical changes.",
    "1051": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard involves separating iron from other materials without changing their chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are created or destroyed.\n- Sewing an apron involves manipulating fabric and thread to create a garment. While sewing can involve some minor chemical reactions (like the melting of threads), the primary change is the physical arrangement of the fabric and thread into a new form. Therefore, it is also considered a physical change.\n\nBoth activities do not involve any chemical reactions that alter the fundamental nature of the materials involved, making them both examples of physical changes.",

    "1071": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (S-N), while in Pair 2, they are facing the same poles towards each other (N-S). Since opposite poles attract and like poles repel, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be attractive, while the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be repulsive. However, since all the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic properties should be similar, and thus the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs.\n",

    "1152": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 17 u and the average particle speed is 930 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 28 u and the average particle speed is 1,100 m/s.\n\nWe can use the formula for kinetic energy, KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity of the particle. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can compare the kinetic energies by comparing the products of the masses and velocities squared.\n\nFor Sample A:\nKE_A = 0.5 * 17 u * (930 m/s)^2\n\nFor Sample B:\nKE_B = 0.5 * 28 u * (1,100 m/s)^2\n\nSince the velocity of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the mass of the particles in Sample B is also greater, the product of the mass and velocity squared for Sample B will be larger than that for Sample A. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is higher than that in Sample A.\n\nSince the average kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature, Sample B has the higher temperature.\n",

    "1177": "The answer is A. Porcupine. \n\nPorcupines have sharp quills that can be used as a defense mechanism against predators. When threatened, they will raise their quills and may even charge at the predator, causing them to retreat. The sharp spines covering the skin of the thorny devil in the image also serve a similar purpose, making it difficult for predators to attack or eat them. However, the thorny devil's spines are not as sharp as those of a porcupine, so the porcupine would be considered better adapted to hurt an attacking predator based on the options provided.\n",

    "1182": "The answer is A. Chital.\n\nChital, also known as spotted deer or axis deer, is a species of deer native to the Indian subcontinent. They are known for their long necks, which allow them to reach high branches and browse on leaves and twigs in trees. This adaptation helps them access food sources that are out of reach for other herbivores, providing them with a competitive advantage in their environment. The bison, on the other hand, is a large bovine species native to North America and Eurasia, and its neck is not adapted for reaching high branches.\n",

The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. \n\nThis can be inferred by considering that all the magnets are made of the same material, meaning they have the same magnetic properties. Additionally, the distance between the magnets in each pair is the same, as indicated by the length of the line connecting the magnets. Since the material and distance are constant, the only variable affecting the magnetic force would be the shape of the magnets. However, since the shapes of the magnets in each pair are identical, the magnetic force should remain consistent across both pairs.\n",

They have long arms and strong hands with opposable thumbs that allow them to grasp branches and move through the trees easily. Chimpanzees also have a flexible spine and strong legs that help them balance while climbing. These adaptations make them well-suited for life in the forest canopy, where they spend much of their time searching for food and socializing with other chimpanzees.\n\nIn contrast, red-necked wallabies are marsupials native to Australia. They are herbivores and primarily feed on grasses and leaves. While they can climb trees, their limbs are not as well-adapted for this activity as those of chimpanzees or other arboreal animals. Instead, they use their strong hind legs to hop around on the ground and their front paws to grasp branches and pull themselves up into the trees. However, their limbs are not as specialized for climbing as those of chimpanzees, so they are not as efficient at it.\n",

    "1256": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 1 are larger than the magnets in Pair 2, and the size of a magnet affects its magnetic strength. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields, so the magnets in Pair 1 will exert a greater magnetic force on each other compared to the smaller magnets in Pair 2. Additionally, the shape of the magnets can also affect their magnetic properties, but since all the magnets are made of the same material, the size difference is the primary factor that determines the magnitude of the magnetic force in this case.\n",

Option A does not provide any direct evidence of Edna's knowledge or interest in history, as it only mentions her interest in American history, which may or may not be related to her overall knowledge of history. Therefore, option B provides more relevant information to support the conclusion that Edna has acquired the trait of knowing a lot about history through learning and reading.\n",
    "1935": "The answer is B. Rock is a solid substance, while water in a fishbowl and milk are both liquids.",
    "1938": "The answer is B. A heart-shaped plant can produce eggs and sperm as it is part of the reproductive phase in the life cycle of a fern, where the spores develop into gametophytes that produce both male and female gametes (sperm and egg cells). These gametes then fuse to form a zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte (mature fern plant), completing the life cycle.\n",
    "1944": "The answer is A. Chiasmus is a figure of speech where words or phrases are repeated in reverse order to create a parallel structure. In this case, \"That's old news\" and \"He's been planning that for months\" are both reversed versions of each other, making it an example of chiasmus.\n",

    "1968": "The answer is A.\n",
    "1969": "The answer is A. The flowers of an apple tree contain the reproductive parts that produce seeds after pollination and fertilization. The fruit, on the other hand, is the part of the plant that develops from the ovary after fertilization and contains the seeds inside it. However, the seeds themselves are produced by the flowers, not the fruit.\n",
    "1973": "The answer is A. The statement \"Our five-cent coin is called a nickel, but it's mostly made of copper\" is a fact because it provides specific information about the composition of a coin. On the other hand, option B is an opinion or subjective statement as it expresses a value judgment about the worth of a nickel in today's economy.",
    "1975": "The answer is D. The country highlighted in green on the map is the Dominican Republic.\n",
    "1983": "The answer is C. 38 centimeters. \n\nThis is because caterpillars typically grow to be around 2-4 inches in length, which is equivalent to approximately 50-100 millimeters or 2-4 centimeters. Therefore, option C (38 centimeters) is the most reasonable estimate among the given options.",
    "1984": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the given context, the statement \"Beth's parents have red hair. They passed down this trait to Beth\" provides evidence that Beth inherited the red hair trait from her parents. This indicates that the trait is likely genetic, as it was passed down through the family line. The other option, \"Beth and her mother both wear their hair in braids,\" does not provide any direct information about the inheritance of the red hair trait; it only describes an observable behavior related to hair styling.",
    "1986": "The answer is B. EE.\n\nExplanation: Since Bianca has brown eyes and the allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e), Bianca must have two copies of the dominant allele (EE). This means her genotype is EE, indicating that she has brown eyes due to the dominance of the brown-eye allele.",

    "1997": "The answer is A. Kelp.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the arrow points from kelp to the bat star, indicating that the bat star consumes the kelp. Therefore, the matter contained within the kelp will eventually move to the bat star as it is consumed.\n",
    "1999": "The answer is A. oxygen.\n\nThe text states that \"Living organisms take in and release some of these gases\" and \"Gases in the atmosphere also help insulate Earth from extreme temperatures and block some harmful forms of sunlight.\" This implies that living organisms rely on the atmosphere for gases such as oxygen, which they take in and release. Sunlight, on the other hand, is not mentioned as something that organisms rely on from the atmosphere.\n",
    "2006": "The answer is C. Using only the available supplies, Rita can investigate whether squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost. This is because she has access to a compost pile, which allows her to compare the growth of squash plants grown with compost to those grown without it.

    "2031": "The answer is B.\n\nExplanation: Bryant's test involved putting a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel and observing its behavior at 200 km per hour. This test would allow him to determine how steady the parachute was at this speed, as he was specifically interested in the movement of the parachute and its potential impact on the spacecraft. Option A is incorrect because the test did not involve a speed of 400 km per hour, only 200 km per hour. Option C is also incorrect because the test did not involve damaging the spacecraft; rather, it was focused on observing the behavior of the parachute itself.\n",
    "2036": "The answer is B.\n\nIn the context provided, \"factoid\" traditionally refers to a piece of information that is presented as true but is actually false or misleading. Option B describes Tracy's dislike of certain sci-fi movies because they present \"factoids\" that misrepresent her field, which aligns with the traditional usage of the term. Option A uses \"factoid\" in a more general sense, referring to any piece of information, without implying that it is necessarily false or misleading.\n",
    "2041": "The answer is A. If Henry decides to plant the hickory tree, the cost would be that the hickory tree will use up more space than the carnations would have used up. This means there might be less space available for other activities or plants in his backyard, which could limit his ability to enjoy the backyard as much as he would like. On the other hand, option B describes a benefit rather than a cost, as it indicates that Henry will get to see the hickory tree and find it more beautiful than the carnations.",
    "2056": "The answer is A. The colder soccer ball has less thermal energy compared to the hotter soccer ball. Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy its particles possess, resulting in greater thermal energy. Therefore, the colder soccer ball will have less thermal energy than the hotter one.\n",
    "2059": "The answer is A. \n\nTracy has one bar of milk chocolate and one bar of dark chocolate, as well as a stove and a pot. With these supplies, she can set up an experiment to compare the melting rates of milk chocolate and dark chocolate when heated on the stove. This allows her to investigate option A: \"Does milk chocolate or dark chocolate melt faster when heated on the stove?\" \n\nShe cannot investigate option B because she does not have any white chocolate bars. Option C is also not possible since she does not have a microwave available for heating the chocolate. Therefore, using only the given supplies, Tracy can only conduct an experiment to determine if milk chocolate or dark chocolate melts faster when heated on the stove.\n",

    "2083": "The answer is B.\n",
    "2088": "The answer is B. Apostrophe is a figure of speech where a person or thing is addressed directly as if it were alive and capable of understanding. In this case, Lord Byron is addressing the ocean as if it were a living being, which is an example of apostrophe.",
    "2096": "The answer is B.\n\nCameron's test showed how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour. By observing the parachute in the wind tunnel, he could determine if the vent caused the parachute to swing too much at this speed. This information would help him decide if the vent size was appropriate for the spacecraft's landing on Mars. Option A is incorrect because Cameron did not test the effect of the vent on the spacecraft itself, only the parachute. Option C is also incorrect because Cameron tested the parachute at 200 km per hour, not 400 km per hour.\n",
    "2102": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the title of the book is enclosed in quotation marks, which is the standard format for book titles. Option B uses asterisks (*) instead of quotation marks, which is not the correct way to denote a book title. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",
    "2108": "The answer is B. Hayley learned biology by reading, observing, and experimenting.

    "2136": "The answer is D. Madison is the capital of Wisconsin.\n",
    "2137": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Crushing a mineral into powder involves breaking down the solid mineral into smaller pieces without changing its fundamental composition or creating new substances. This process is purely mechanical and does not involve any chemical reactions, making it a physical change.\n- Knitting yarn into a scarf involves manipulating the fibers to create a fabric structure. This process also does not involve any chemical reactions; instead, it involves physical actions like pulling, looping, and interlocking the yarn strands. Therefore, knitting is also a physical change.\n\nBoth activities\u2014crushing a mineral and knitting yarn\u2014are examples of physical changes because they do not alter the chemical composition of the materials involved. They simply rearrange the existing matter in different forms without creating new substances.",
    "2144": "The answer is B. \n\nOption B provides evidence that Olivia inherited the trait of having straight hair because it indicates that both her biological parents have red hair, and she also has red hair. This suggests that the trait of having straight hair could be influenced by genetic factors passed down from her parents. However, it is important to note that genetics alone does not determine hair texture; other factors such as environment and lifestyle can also play a role. Option A is not relevant since it only mentions a neighbor with straight hair, which does not provide any direct information about Olivia's genetic inheritance. Option C is also not relevant as it only describes Olivia's mother's habit of wearing her hair in a ponytail, which does not provide any information about the genetic inheritance of her hair texture.\n",

    "2232": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Preston couldn't find the definition for flax in the book's glossary, so he looked it up online,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" This makes it a compound sentence because it contains two main ideas that could stand alone as separate sentences but are connected to form one complete thought. Option A is a simple sentence, as it only contains one independent clause.\n",
    "2238": "The answer is C. Lion.\n\nLions are animals that are part of the animal kingdom, while windmills, paper clips, and brick walls are inanimate objects or man-made structures. Therefore, only option C, the lion, is a living thing.\n",
    "2241": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Crushing a mineral into powder involves breaking down the solid mineral into smaller pieces without changing its chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are formed.\n- Pouring milk on oatmeal involves mixing two substances but does not alter their chemical properties; it merely combines them physically. This is also a physical change.\n\nNeither of these processes results in the formation of new substances or involves any chemical reactions, making both purely physical changes.",
    "2245": "The answer is A. Since both objects have the same mass (750 grams), the one with the higher temperature (95\u00b0F) will have more thermal energy. Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy its particles possess, resulting in more overall thermal energy. Therefore, option A, the 750-gram rock at 95\u00b0F, has more thermal energy than the 750-gram rock at 20\u00b0F.\n",
    "2249": "The answer is A. The hotter drop of honey has more thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object possesses.

It is important to note that the time may vary depending on factors such as the individual's fitness level, speed, and technique. However, 22 seconds is a reasonable estimate for completing ten jumping jacks.",
    "2415": "The answer is B. Thistles are a type of flowering plant covered in prickly spines. Thistle plant cells contain chloroplasts, and their flowers contain nectar that attracts birds and butterflies. This indicates that thistles are capable of photosynthesis, as they possess chloroplasts within their cells, which are essential for the process of photosynthesis. On the other hand, red sea urchins are marine animals that obtain minerals from the water to form their spines, but they do not have chloroplasts or the ability to perform photosynthesis. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, thistles are the photosynthetic organism.\n",
    "2427": "The answer is A. Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it contains more green particles in relation to its solvent volume compared to Solution B. Solution A has 9 green particles in 45 mL of solvent, while Solution B has 6 green particles in 45 mL of solvent. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of solute particles.\n",

    "3137": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 because the magnets in Pair 2 are larger than the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic properties are similar. However, the size of the magnets affects the strength of the magnetic field they produce. Larger magnets generally produce stronger magnetic fields, resulting in a greater magnetic force between them. Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "3160": "The answer is D. Both are caused by heating.\n\nExplanation: Carving a piece of wood involves using tools to remove material from the wood, which is a physical change as it does not alter the chemical composition of the wood. However, the process can be influenced by heat if the carving tool is heated to make it sharper or more effective. Water boiling on a stove is a chemical change because water molecules break down into hydrogen and oxygen gases during the boiling process. But the boiling itself is caused by heating the water to its boiling point. Therefore, both activities involve heating as a cause, even though they are fundamentally different types of changes.",

    "3223": "The answer is A. As Edna rode down the hill, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased due to the decrease in height. This is because gravitational potential energy is directly proportional to the height above a reference point, so as the sled moves downward, its height decreases, resulting in a decrease in gravitational potential energy.\n",
    "3224": "The answer is A. The metaphor suggests that despite losing his job, there was still a positive aspect or opportunity for Devin, which was the prospect of pursuing a new career. This implies that even though the situation was difficult, it also presented an opportunity for growth and change.",
    "3228": "The answer is A. Covering its eggs with its body increases the chances that the leech's eggs will hatch.\n\nExplanation: According to the passage, the leech flattens its body over its eggs to protect them. This behavior helps to prevent the eggs from being eaten by predators like water snails. Since the passage states that water snails cannot easily get to eggs that are covered by a leech, it suggests that covering the eggs with its body increases the chances that the leech's eggs will hatch successfully. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.\n",
    "3232": "The answer is C. Santa Fe.\n",

    "3282": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be determined by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is larger than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker compared to the force between the magnets in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.\n",

    "3909": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Serengeti National Park is located in Tanzania, a country in eastern Africa. Eastern Africa experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, the area receives heavy rainfall, while during the dry season, there is little to no precipitation. This seasonal variation in rainfall affects the vegetation and wildlife in the region.\n\nIn addition to the seasonal rainfall, the soil in the Serengeti National Park is generally poor in nutrients. This is due to the high temperatures and intense sunlight in the region, which cause rapid decomposition of organic matter and leaching of nutrients from the soil. As a result, the soil in the park is often low in fertility, which can limit the growth of plants and affect the availability of food for herbivores and carnivores.\n\nTherefore, option B, \"It has a rainy season and a dry season.

    "4268": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 44 u and the average particle speed is 840 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average particle speed is 1,000 m/s.\n\nSince the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A, but the average particle speed in Sample B is also greater, it is difficult to determine which sample has the higher average kinetic energy without more information. However, based on the given information, we can only conclude that Sample B has a higher average particle speed, which suggests that it may have a higher temperature. Therefore, the answer is A.\n",

    "5289": "The answer is A. It has cold, wet winters. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.\n\nThis option is more accurate because the Monongahela National Forest is located in eastern West Virginia, where the climate is generally mild to cool with moderate rainfall throughout the year. The soil in this region is often acidic and nutrient-poor due to the weathering of the underlying rock and the leaching of nutrients by rainwater. These factors contribute to the growth of temperate deciduous forests, which are characterized by their ability to thrive in these conditions. In contrast, option B is incorrect because the Monongahela National Forest does not have soil that is rich in nutrients or only a few types of trees. Instead, it is home to a diverse array of plant species, including many different types of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation.",
    "5290": "The answer is B. The statement \"More than eight million people live in New York City\" is a fact because it can be verified through population data or census records.

    "5520": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5523": "The answer is B.\n\nZoe's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin as she had intended. Option A is incorrect because the test does not measure the growth rate of the bacteria, only the amount of insulin produced. Option C is also incorrect because the test only involved one type of bacteria, so it cannot determine whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin.\n",
    "5524": "The answer is B. \"A bullheaded employee\" has a more negative connotation because it implies stubbornness or a lack of willingness to change one's mind or approach, which can be seen as uncooperative or resistant to feedback or suggestions. On the other hand, \"a persistent employee\" suggests someone who is determined and keeps trying, which is generally viewed positively in most work environments.",
    "5531": "The answer is D. 18 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a hammer is typically a small tool used in construction or woodworking, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than meters or kilometers. Millimeters would be too small to accurately describe the length of a hammer, while meters or kilometers would be too large. Therefore, 18 centimeters is the most appropriate estimate for the length of a hammer.",
    "5532": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the food web shown, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the arrow points from the lichen to the collared lemming, indicating that the collared lemming consumes the lichen. Therefore, the collared lemming contains matter that was once part of the lichen.\n",
    "5538": "The answer is D. Antarctica.\n",
    "5541": "The answer is B. This is a declarative sentence because it makes a statement about Helen considering Paris as the most romantic city in the world. Declarative sentences express facts or opinions without asking a question or expressing emotion.",
    "5544": "The answer is B. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. According to the inverse square law, the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Therefore, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller, the magnetic force between them will be stronger compared to the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "5546": "The answer is A. \n\nSince both objects are identical in mass and material, the one with the lower temperature will have less thermal energy. Therefore, the 250-gram mug of cocoa at 90\u00b0F has less thermal energy than the 250-gram mug of cocoa at 95\u00b0F.",
    "5549": "The answer is A. Arctic fox.\n\nAn omnivore is an organism that eats both plants and animals. In the food web shown, the Arctic fox is shown to eat both the collared lemming (an animal) and the bilberry (a plant). Therefore, the Arctic fox is an omnivore.\n",
    "5550": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5551": "The answer is C. \"Cane\" does not rhyme with \"pine\" or \"dine.\"",
    "5555": "The answer is C. \n\nIn this context, the object with the least thermal energy would be the one with the lowest temperature. Since all three options refer to bowls of oatmeal, we can assume that they are made of the same material and size, so the only difference between them is their temperature. Therefore, the bowl of oatmeal at 101\u00b0F would have the least thermal energy compared to the other two options, as it has the lowest temperature among the three.",
    "5556": "The answer is A. \n\nOption A provides evidence that both Susan's biological parents possess the trait of having red hair, and Susan herself has red hair. This suggests that Susan may have inherited the gene responsible for red hair from one or both of her parents, supporting the conclusion that she inherited the trait. \n\nOption B only mentions Susan's mother's behavior of wearing her hair in a ponytail, which does not provide any direct evidence of Susan inheriting the trait from her mother. \n\nOption C only mentions that Susan's neighbor has straight hair, but this does not provide any information about Susan's genetic inheritance of the trait. \n\nTherefore, option A is the most appropriate choice to support the conclusion that Susan inherited the trait of having straight hair.\n",
    "5565": "The answer is A. Dover.\n",
    "5572": "The answer is A. The thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each aquarium during this time. This can be inferred from the fact that both the covered and uncovered aquariums experienced a decrease in temperature, indicating that heat was being lost to the surrounding environment.",
    "5575": "The answer is A. The plant has the homozygous genotype ff, which means it has two recessive alleles for fuzzy fruit. Since the allele for fuzzy fruit (f) is recessive and there are no dominant alleles present, the plant will express the recessive trait, resulting in fuzzy fruit as its phenotype.\n",
    "5579": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.\n\nThis can be inferred by observing that all the magnets are made of the same material, so they have the same magnetic properties. Additionally, the distance between the magnets in each pair is the same, as indicated by the 4-inch scale. Since the material and distance are constant, the only variable affecting the magnetic force would be the size and shape of the magnets themselves. However, since the magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same size and shape, the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs.\n",
    "5586": "The answer is B.\n",
    "5588": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"this sweatshirt\" could refer to either David or Eric, making it unclear who the sweatshirt belongs to. This creates a vague pronoun reference. Option B uses the pronoun \"his,\" which clearly refers to one of the two people mentioned in the sentence, thus avoiding the vagueness present in option A.\n",
    "5590": "The answer is A. \n\nSince Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene, and the allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i), Kraken will express the dominant trait, which is a spotted tail. Therefore, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait is a spotted tail.\n",
    "5591": "The answer is B. 30 grams. \n\nA small candy bar typically weighs around 30 grams, making option B the more accurate estimate compared to option A, which is 30 kilograms. 30 kilograms would be an extremely large amount for a small candy bar, as most candy bars weigh much less than that.",
    "5595": "The answer is A. Shelley's naturally pale skin is an inherited trait because it is determined by her genetic makeup, which she received from her parents during conception. Skin color is influenced by multiple genes, and people with lighter skin tones often have a higher concentration of melanin-producing cells in their skin, which is controlled by genetic factors. Therefore, pale skin is typically passed down through generations as an inherited trait.\n",

    "5605": "The answer is B.\n",
    "5619": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases with increasing distance between them, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker than the force between the magnets in Pair 2.\n",
    "5620": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"It\" could refer to either the new software or the add-ons, making it unclear which one is being explained. This creates a vague pronoun reference. Option B clearly states that the website is explaining how to install the new software and download add-ons, so there is no ambiguity in the pronoun reference.\n",
    "5622": "The answer is B. The term \"spartan\" refers to the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, known for its strict military discipline and simplicity. This allusion comes from Greek history, as Sparta was famous for its austere lifestyle and rigorous training regimen.",
    "5624": "The answer is D.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring: FF, Ff, ff, and Ff. Out of these four combinations, only one combination (FF) is homozygous dominant for the fruit sheen gene. Therefore, the probability that a cucumber plant produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the fruit sheen gene is 1 out of 4, or 1/4.\n",
    "5626": "The answer is A. The sentence uses a simile because it compares Uncle Logan's laughter to thunder using the word \"booming\" as a connecting term. A simile explicitly states that one thing is like another by using words such as \"like,\" \"as,\" or \"than.\" In contrast, a metaphor directly states that one thing is another without using these connecting terms.",

    "5647": "The answer is B. The magnets will attract each other because opposite poles (N and S) are facing each other. Opposite poles attract each other, while like poles (N and N or S and S) repel each other.",
    "5652": "The answer is B. Feather.\n\nIn the provided image, the fern fossil is located in the top layer, while the feather fossil is found in the bottom layer. Since the layers represent different time periods, with the top layer being shallower and thus older than the bottom layer, the fern fossil is older than the feather fossil. Therefore, the feather fossil is younger.\n",
    "5660": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, it is important to use proper punctuation and capitalization. Therefore, the correct way to write the closing would be \"With love,\" followed by a comma and then the name \"Devin.\" This ensures that the closing is properly formatted and easy to read.\n",
    "5677": "The answer is B. \n\nIn a dictionary, words are arranged in alphabetical order. Guide words at the top of each page indicate the first and last words on that page. If the guide words are \"galleon\" and \"glorious,\" any word appearing between these two words alphabetically will be found on that page. Since \"goose\" comes after \"galleon\" but before \"glorious\" in the alphabet, it would be found on the same page as those guide words.",

    "5765": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.\n\nThis can be inferred by observing that the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1.\n",
    "5768": "The answer is B. Attract.\n\nIn the image, there are two U-shaped magnets with their poles labeled. The top magnet has its north pole (N) facing downward and its south pole (S) facing upward. The bottom magnet also has its north pole (N) facing downward and its south pole (S) facing upward. Since like poles repel each other and opposite poles attract each other, the north pole of the top magnet will attract the south pole of the bottom magnet, and vice versa. Therefore, the magnets will attract each other.\n",
    "5772": "The answer is A. Since both boxes are the same shape and size, the difference in weight between the two boxes will determine the force required to lift them. The box holding 42 pounds would require more force to lift compared to the box holding 39 pounds because it weighs more. Therefore, the mover lifting the box holding 42 pounds would be exerting a greater force.",

    "5779": "The answer is B.\n",
    "5785": "The answer is C. neither; the samples have the same temperature.\n\nExplanation: Since both samples have the same mass of each particle and the same average particle speed, their average kinetic energies will be equal. Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, since the average kinetic energies of the particles in both samples are equal, they have the same temperature.\n",
    "5788": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Beth learned to speak two languages, which directly supports the conclusion that she acquired the ability to speak two languages as a result of her learning experience. Option A does not provide any evidence or context about how Beth acquired the ability to speak two languages; it only states that her mother speaks one language, which may or may not be relevant to Beth's language acquisition.\n",
    "5791": "The answer is D. Thread is a solid object, while air inside a beach ball, chocolate syrup, and apple juice are all liquids or gases.",
    "5794": "The answer is A. 20 ounces. \n\nThis is because a standard box of cereal typically weighs around 20 ounces or approximately 0.5 kilograms. It would be unusual to find a box of cereal weighing 20 pounds (which is equivalent to 320 ounces) or 20 tons (which is equivalent to 320,000 ounces). Therefore, option A is the most reasonable estimate for the mass of a full box of cereal.\n",

    "5884": "The answer is B. Feather.\n\nIn the diagram, the feather fossil is located in the top layer of the undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence, while the crocodile egg fossil is found in the bottom layer. Since the top layer represents shallower water and the bottom layer represents deeper water, it can be inferred that the feather fossil is younger than the crocodile egg fossil. This is because the feather fossil was deposited closer to the surface of the water, where it would have been exposed to less pressure and erosion compared to the crocodile egg fossil, which was buried deeper in the sedimentary rock sequence.\n",
    "5902": "The answer is B. \"Grandma Bella and Grandpa Fred kiss the children before bed\" is a complete sentence because it contains a subject (\"Grandma Bella and Grandpa Fred\") and a predicate (\"kiss the children before bed\"). It expresses a complete thought and conveys a clear meaning. On the other hand, option A is not a complete sentence as it lacks a verb and does not express a complete thought.\n",

    "5921": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four squares show the genotype \"Bb\". Since the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b), any offspring with the genotype \"Bb\" will have a normal-sized body. Therefore, the probability that a rat produced by this cross will have a dwarf body is 0 out of 4, or 0/4.",
    "5923": "The answer is A. The statement \"The Phantom of the Opera became the longest running show in Broadway history on January 9, 2006\" is a fact because it provides specific information about an event that occurred on a particular date.

    "5927": "The answer is A. \n\nWater balloons typically hold around 500-600 milliliters of water, so option A (515 milliliters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option B (515 liters), which would be an extremely large amount of water for a single water balloon.",
    "5935": "The answer is B. The anthers are the part of the flower that produce pollen, so pollinators like bees or butterflies typically pick up pollen from the anthers as they visit the flower to collect nectar or pollen for their own use.\n",
    "5941": "The answer is A. \n\nSince the plant has the homozygous genotype \"ff\" for the fruit color gene, it means that both alleles are recessive (f). According to the given information, the allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f). Therefore, the presence of two recessive alleles (ff) results in the recessive phenotype, which is green fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait is green fruit.",
    "5945": "The answer is B. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the implication that it is quiet. The phrase \"as quiet as a jackhammer\" is used to emphasize how loud the snoring is, making it ironic because jackhammers are known for their extremely loud noise.",

    "6419": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (S-N), which means they will attract each other. However, in Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force would be the same in both pairs. However, since the direction of the force is different, we cannot say that one pair has a stronger or weaker force than the other. Therefore, the correct answer is C - the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 because it involves repulsion instead of attraction.\n",

    "6898": "The answer is A. It would take approximately 50 hours to drain all of the water in a full bathtub, assuming that the drain is functioning properly and there are no obstructions. This is because a typical bathtub can hold around 40-70 gallons of water, and a standard household faucet can drain about 2-3 gallons per minute. Therefore, it would take roughly 20-35 minutes to drain one gallon of water, and multiplying that by the total amount of water in the tub gives us an estimate of 50 hours. Option B, 50 seconds, is too short to drain even a small amount of water from a bathtub.\n",
    "6909": "The answer is B. Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat because he has the homozygous genotype LL, which means he has two copies of the dominant allele L for a black coat. Since the allele for a red coat (l) is recessive, it would only be expressed if both alleles were l, which is not the case here. Therefore, Boxer will have a black coat as his phenotype.",

This adaptation allows the marsh terrapin to pull its soft parts into its shell when attacked, providing an additional layer of protection. In contrast, the ring-necked pheasant does not have a hard outer shell and is more vulnerable to predators with sharp teeth.\n",
    "6972": "The answer is B. Physical change. \n\nCracks forming in concrete due to changes in temperature does not involve the formation or breaking down of new substances, but rather a change in the physical state of the material. This is because the temperature change causes the concrete to expand and contract, leading to the formation of cracks. Since no new substances are being created or destroyed, this is considered a physical change.",
    "6973": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"He won't get lost, I will give him directions\" is a run-on sentence because it combines two independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions to separate them. It should be written as either \"He won't get lost; I will give him directions.\" or \"He won't get lost, and I will give him directions.\"\n\nOption B, \"Goes on a big adventure,\" is a simple sentence with only one independent clause, so it is not a run-on sentence.\n",

    "7242": "The answer is B. An icicle is harder than a wool sweater because it is made of ice, which is a solid form of water that is typically colder and more rigid than the fibers in a wool sweater. Wool sweaters, on the other hand, are made of soft, flexible fibers that can be easily manipulated and shaped into various forms. While both items may have their own unique properties and uses, an icicle would generally be considered harder due to its solid composition compared to the softer, more pliable nature of wool.",
    "7243": "The answer is A. This is an imperative sentence because it gives a command or instruction to \"don't overlook Arianna when choosing the new principal.\"\n",
    "7247": "The answer is B. The phrase \"Sword of Damocles\" is an allusion to an ancient legend involving King Dionysius I of Syracuse. According to the story, Damocles, a courtier of Dionysius, was granted a wish by the king to sit at his table and dine with him. However, Dionysius placed a sword hanging above Damocles' head, suspended by a single hair, symbolizing the constant threat of death that hangs over those who enjoy power or wealth. This allusion highlights the precarious nature of Will's newfound riches and the potential consequences of his lifestyle choices.\n",
    "7251": "The answer is B. The simile \"as cold as ice\" suggests that the person being described is indifferent or uncaring towards their feelings or relationships, rather than physically cold. The phrase implies that they are emotionally distant or unfeeling, which is consistent with the idea of sacrificing love. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the song is about someone who doesn't care.",
    "7254": "The answer is B. To determine which goose was moving at the highest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each goose by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: Speed = Distance / Time = 360 miles / 10 hours = 36 miles per hour\n- For option B: Speed = Distance / Time = 650 miles / 10 hours = 65 miles per hour\n- For option C: Speed = Distance / Time = 275 miles / 10 hours = 27.5 miles per hour\n\nComparing these speeds:\n- Option A: 36 miles per hour\n- Option B: 65 miles per hour\n- Option C: 27.5 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the goose that moved 650 miles south in 10 hours (option B) was moving at the highest speed.",
    "7256": "The answer is A. The information supporting the conclusion that Lisa acquired the scar on her right elbow is that it was caused by an accident where she cut her arm while falling off her bicycle. This indicates that the scar is likely a result of an external event rather than being a naturally occurring trait or one that is passed down genetically. \n\nOption B does not provide any information about how Lisa acquired the scar; it only mentions that her sister has a bruise from falling on her elbow, which is unrelated to Lisa's situation.\n\nOption C provides information about Lisa's father having a scar on his right elbow but does not explain how Lisa acquired her own scar. It is possible that Lisa's father could have had a similar accident or injury that resulted in a scar on his elbow, but this does not necessarily mean that Lisa acquired her scar through the same means.\n",

Euphemism.\n\nIn this context, \"old news\" is being used as a euphemism to soften or avoid directly stating that Trent's leaving his job is something that has already happened and is no longer newsworthy. Euphemisms are words or phrases that are used instead of potentially offensive, harsh, or blunt terms to express something in a more indirect or less direct way. In this case, saying \"old news\" instead of directly stating that Trent has left his job avoids the directness and potential awkwardness of the situation.\n",

    "7345": "The answer is A. Mason's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes. This suggests that Mason may have inherited the trait of having hazel eyes from his father, as the trait can be influenced by genetic factors passed down through generations.

    "7448": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Making paper from wood involves breaking down wood fibers into pulp through a process called pulping, which includes chemical reactions to separate the fibers. This is considered a chemical change because new substances are formed during the process.\n- Rusting on a metal gate is a chemical reaction between iron in the metal and oxygen in the air, resulting in the formation of iron oxide (rust). This is also a chemical change as it involves the transformation of one substance into another.\n\nTherefore, both processes involve chemical changes rather than being purely physical or caused by cooling or heating.",

    "7672": "The answer is B. 48 liters. \n\nThis is because a car's gas tank typically holds a significant amount of fuel, usually measured in liters or gallons. 48 milliliters would be an extremely small volume, far too little to fill a car's gas tank. Therefore, option B, 48 liters, is the better estimate for the volume of a car's gas tank.",
    "7678": "The answer is C. Hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations.\n\nIn the given text, the person is making a broad claim about the entire book based on their limited experience with just a couple of pages. This is an example of a hasty generalization because they are drawing a conclusion about the entire book without having read it thoroughly.",
    "7681": "The answer is B. The statement \"The Statue of Liberty is made of copper\" is a fact because it can be verified through historical records or physical inspection. On the other hand, \"The Statue of Liberty is easy to recognize\" is an opinion, as it is subjective and based on personal perception.",
    "7683": "The answer is A. In option A, \"literally\" is used in its traditional sense to mean \"in fact\" or \"actually.\" It describes the actual experience of Garrett drinking milk to alleviate the spiciness of the curry. Option B uses \"literally\" metaphorically to describe the intense spiciness of the curry as if it were physically burning Garrett's mouth, which is not its traditional meaning.\n",

    "7739": "The answer is B.\n\nMarshall's test involved putting a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel and observing its behavior at 200 km per hour. This test would allow him to determine how steady the parachute was at this specific speed, as he was interested in understanding the potential for the parachute to swing wildly and potentially damage the spacecraft. Option A is incorrect because the test did not involve a speed of 400 km per hour, only 200 km per hour. Option C is also incorrect because the test did not involve observing any damage to the spacecraft; instead, it focused on the behavior of the parachute itself.\n",
    "7742": "The answer is B.\n",
    "7745": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance, the magnetic force will be stronger in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "7747": "The answer is C. As the water balloon falls towards Sandeep, its height relative to the ground decreases, resulting in a decrease in its gravitational potential energy. This is because gravitational potential energy is directly proportional to the height of an object above a reference point, such as the ground. Therefore, as the water balloon descends, its gravitational potential energy decreases.\n",
    "7748": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Gabriel's parents had straight hair, which implies they likely passed the trait responsible for straight hair to Gabriel through their genes.

    "7765": "The answer is A.\n",
    "7776": "The answer is A. The text uses verbal irony, where the speaker says something that is opposite to their actual meaning. In this case, Jason's room is described as \"tidy\" while being compared to an \"overgrown garden,\" which implies that it is actually untidy or messy. This creates a contrast between the literal meaning of the words and the intended meaning, making it an example of verbal irony.\n",
    "7777": "The answer is B. Amy learned to speak two languages in school. This option directly supports the conclusion that Amy acquired the ability to speak two languages as it indicates an educational or learning process rather than a genetic predisposition or family background.",
    "7787": "The answer is C. \n\nThis option suggests that both Jayce's biological parents have wavy hair, which implies that there is a genetic predisposition for wavy hair in their family. This supports the conclusion that Jayce inherited the wavy hair trait from his parents. Option A does not provide enough information to determine if the trait was inherited or if it could be due to environmental factors. Option B indicates that Jayce is using a headband to manage his hair, which does not provide any information about the inheritance of the trait.",

    "7807": "The answer is C. Solution A.\n\nIn Solution A, there are more green particles (solute) in relation to the solvent volume compared to Solution B. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.\n",
    "7811": "The answer is B. First, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited. Later, a layer of sand was deposited.\n\nThe text states that the river deposited heavy sediment grains along its banks, while light sediment like mud was carried away by the strong water current. This indicates that initially, there was a layer of sand and pebbles deposited by the river. Over time, the river dried up, and the area became a desert. In the desert, sediment was deposited by wind, resulting in the formation of sand dunes. Therefore, the correct answer is B - first, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited, followed by a layer of sand deposited by wind.\n",

Therefore, both scenarios involve chemical changes.\n",
    "9124": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn the given diagram, both samples have the same average particle speed (1,400 m/s). However, the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A (46 u vs. 28 u).\n\nSince the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the difference in temperature between the two samples depends on the difference in their masses. According to the equation for kinetic energy (KE = 0.5 * m * v^2), where m is the mass of the particle and v is its velocity, a larger mass results in a larger kinetic energy for a given velocity.\n\nTherefore, since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is higher than that of the particles in Sample A. Consequently, Sample B has the higher temperature.\n",
    "9126": "The answer is D: compound-complex.\n\nThis sentence is considered compound-complex because it contains multiple independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions (and), as well as one or more dependent clauses that modify an independent clause.

    "9854": "The answer is D. Both are caused by heating.\n\nIn both cases, the change involves heat energy being applied to the substance:\n- Butter melting on a hot day is a result of the butter being heated by the warm temperature of the day, causing it to transition from a solid state to a liquid state.\n- Peeling a banana is not a change that occurs due to heating; rather, it is a manual action where the outer skin of the banana is removed. However, if we consider the peel as a separate entity, peeling could be seen as a form of heating-induced change since the peel can become soft and easier to remove when exposed to heat, though this is not the primary cause of peeling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Both are caused by heating, with the first scenario being a direct result of heating and the second scenario potentially influenced by heating but not primarily caused by it.",
    "9856": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 2 are larger than those in Pair 1, and the size of a magnet affects its magnetic strength.

Both processes require heat to achieve their desired outcomes.\n",
    "9910": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. \n\nThis can be inferred because all the magnets are made of the same material, meaning they have the same magnetic properties. Additionally, the distance between the magnets in each pair is the same, so the strength of the magnetic force depends only on the size and shape of the magnets themselves. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are larger than those in Pair 2, it would be expected that the magnetic force in Pair 1 would be stronger. However, since the problem states that the magnets in different pairs do not affect each other, we cannot assume that the size or shape of the magnets in Pair 2 affects the magnetic force in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force must be the same in both pairs.\n",

    "9997": "The answer is A. Bottlenose dolphin.\n\nThe bottlenose dolphin is a marine mammal that lives in the ocean. It has four flippers that it uses to swim through the water. These flippers are adapted for swimming, allowing the bottlenose dolphin to move quickly and efficiently through the water. The nilgai, on the other hand, is an antelope that lives on land and does not have flippers or any adaptations for swimming. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Bottlenose dolphin.\n",
    "10005": "The answer is A. \n\nAlgernon has two alleles for a dwarf body, which means his genotype is homozygous recessive (bb). This genotype results in the expression of the recessive trait, which in this case is a dwarf body.",
    "10006": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, the pronoun \"them\" does not clearly refer to any specific noun or group within the sentence. It could potentially refer to either the citizens of Seaside or the city council members, making it ambiguous and thus containing a vague pronoun reference.\n",
    "10007": "The answer is B. Four legs. \n\nYou can observe that the fossil of Coelodonta has four legs, as they are clearly visible in the image. The other option, a black snout, cannot be observed on the fossil since it is a preserved skeleton and does not show any coloration or features related to the snout.",
    "10013": "The answer is B. The statement in option B is a fact because it provides specific historical information about an event that occurred in the 1840s involving American fans of Charles Dickens.

It has wings and is capable of soaring through the air, much like the flying fox shown in the figure. The vulture uses its wings to glide and maneuver in the sky, allowing it to hunt for food and navigate its environment. In contrast, the gaur is a large herbivorous mammal native to South and Southeast Asia, and is not adapted for flight. It is instead adapted for running and swimming, as well as for living in dense forests and grasslands.\n",
    "10059": "The answer is B.\n",
    "10060": "The answer is A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie. This is because the force of gravity pulling her down (600N) is less than the force of the seat pushing her up (1,200N). Since the forces are not equal in magnitude, they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force that causes Cassie to accelerate upwards towards the top of the loop.",
    "10077": "The answer is D.\n\nFossil evidence allowed scientists to compare the number of extinct beetle species to the number of other extinct species, which helped them understand why there are so many beetle species today. The text states, \"Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals.\" This comparison helps explain the high number of beetle species because it shows that beetles have a lower extinction rate compared to other animals, indicating that they are more adaptable and resilient to environmental changes.\n",

This adaptation helps them avoid predators and allows them to ambush prey more effectively. Similarly, the plated leaf chameleon is another example of an animal that has evolved to blend into its environment. These chameleons have a unique pattern of scales on their skin that resembles the texture and coloration of leaves, making it difficult for predators to spot them. This adaptation is particularly useful in tropical forests where leaf litter is abundant and provides excellent camouflage for these animals.\n",
    "10153": "The answer is B. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms. In this case, \"something for everyone\" and \"target market\" are contradictory because a target market implies a specific audience, while \"something for everyone\" suggests a broad appeal. Therefore, the use of these terms together creates an oxymoron.\n",
    "10156": "The answer is A. \n\nThe guide words \"shy\" and \"single\" indicate that the word in between would start with an 's'. Since \"stork\" starts with an 's', it would be found on a dictionary page between these guide words. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Yes, you would find the word \"stork\" on a dictionary page with the given guide words.",
    "10157": "The answer is D. Black bear.\n\nIn the food web provided, the black bear is shown to be a tertiary consumer because it preys on the secondary consumers, such as the bobcat and gray fox.

    "10235": "The answer is C.\n\nIn this context, \"join,\" \"link,\" and \"attach\" are all actions that involve connecting or joining things together. However, \"stir\" is an action that involves mixing or agitating something, such as a pot of soup or a cup of coffee. While it can be used metaphorically to suggest making progress or moving forward, it does not fit in with the other options as well as the others do. Therefore, \"stir\" is the action that doesn't belong.\n",

    "10282": "The answer is A. Paradox is a statement that seems contradictory or absurd but may be true in a certain context. In this case, the statement \"you shouldn't go in the water until you know how to swim\" is a paradox because it suggests that one should not enter the water without knowing how to swim, which implies that swimming is necessary to avoid danger in the water. However, the statement also implies that swimming is a skill that can be learned, which contradicts the idea that one should not enter the water without knowing how to swim. This creates a paradoxical situation where the statement both encourages and discourages entering the water.\n",

Option B uses quotation marks around the title, making it the correct choice. Option A uses asterisks instead of quotation marks, which is not the standard format for book titles.\n",
    "10305": "The answer is B. The sentence \"The mayor was furious when she learned that the local newspaper had printed an invasive story about her personal life\" is more formal because it uses the past tense verb \"was furious\" instead of the present tense verb \"flipped out,\" and it also uses the more formal pronoun \"she\" rather than the informal \"her.\" Additionally, the phrase \"when she learned\" is more concise and formal compared to the longer phrase in option A.",
    "10316": "The answer is B. Maryland.\n",
    "10325": "The answer is A. The word \"found\" would be found between the guide words \"flutter\" and \"fur\" in a dictionary because it comes alphabetically after \"flutter\" and before \"fur\".\n",

    "10333": "The answer is B. Flamingos are adapted for flight as they have wings and can fly. Northern elephant seals, on the other hand, are not adapted for flight as they are large marine mammals that spend most of their time swimming and diving underwater to hunt for food.\n",
    "10339": "The answer is A.\n",
    "10354": "The answer is B. Hyperbole is used in this text.

    "10382": "The answer is A. Arctic wolf.\n\nArctic wolves are well-adapted to living in cold, snowy environments. They have thick fur that helps them stay warm in the cold temperatures, and their white fur provides excellent camouflage against the snow. This adaptation allows them to blend in with their surroundings, making it easier for them to hunt and avoid predators. In contrast, porcupines are not typically found in snowy environments, so they do not have adaptations specifically for camouflage in the snow.\n",
    "10383": "The answer is A.\n",
    "10392": "The answer is B. A newspaper is considered a good because it is a tangible product that can be purchased and consumed by consumers. It provides information and entertainment to its readers, but it is not a service as it does not involve providing a service or performing an action for someone else.",

This reduction in production capacity will likely lead to a decrease in the overall supply of cough drops in the market.",
    "10403": "The answer is C. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and gravel and tearing a piece of paper are both examples of physical changes because they involve altering the form or state of matter without changing its fundamental composition. Mixing sand and gravel does not create new substances; it merely combines different materials together. Similarly, tearing a piece of paper does not change the chemical properties of the paper; it simply alters its shape and size. Neither process involves the creation or destruction of molecules, so they are classified as physical changes rather than chemical ones.",

    "10425": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the magnets in Pair 1 will experience a stronger magnetic force compared to the magnets in Pair 2.\n",
    "10435": "The answer is B. The hotter brownie has more thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object possesses. Higher temperatures indicate that the particles within the object are moving faster and thus have more kinetic energy, resulting in more overall thermal energy. Therefore, the brownie with the higher temperature will have more thermal energy than the one with the lower temperature.\n",
    "10436": "The answer is B. Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon involves a chemical reaction that changes the surface composition of the silver, making it less tarnished.

    "11028": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 because the magnets in Pair 2 are larger than the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic strength is proportional to their size. Therefore, the larger magnets in Pair 2 will exert a stronger magnetic force on each other compared to the smaller magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "11031": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Daintree rainforest is located in northeastern Australia, where it experiences year-round warm temperatures due to its proximity to the equator. Additionally, the soil in the rainforest is often poor in nutrients because the rapid decomposition of organic matter by bacteria and fungi leads to the release of nutrients back into the soil rather than building up nutrient reserves. This results in a nutrient-poor soil environment, which can be challenging for plants to thrive in. However, despite these challenges, the Daintree rainforest is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, making it an important ecosystem for biodiversity conservation.\n",

    "11409": "The answer is B. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and their size and shape. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have the same magnetic strength. Therefore, the only factor that affects the magnetic force is the distance between the magnets. In Pair 1, the magnets are closer to each other than in Pair 2, so the magnetic force between them will be stronger. However, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is the same as in Pair 1, the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs.\n",

Additionally, they have a high wing loading, which means that their wings are relatively large compared to their body size, allowing them to generate more lift and stay aloft for longer periods of time. All of these adaptations make the gray-headed albatross an excellent flier and allow it to travel vast distances across the ocean in search of food.\n",
    "11510": "The answer is A. The hotter meatball has more thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object possesses. Higher temperature indicates that the particles in the object are moving faster and thus have more kinetic energy, resulting in more thermal energy overall. Therefore, the meatball with higher temperature will have more thermal energy than the one with lower temperature.\n",

    "12114": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Max's mother has blue eyes. She passed this trait down to Max\" provides evidence that Max inherited the blue eye trait from his mother. This is because traits are passed down through genes from parents to offspring, and in this case, the mother's blue eyes suggest she carries the gene responsible for blue eyes, which she likely passed on to her child, Max. Option A does not provide genetic or familial information, so it cannot support the conclusion that Max inherited the blue eye trait.",
    "12118": "The answer is B. Snowy owls have sharp, curved beaks and live in cold places. They have feathers on their feet to protect them from the cold. Mother owls keep their eggs warm by standing on their shells. This description matches all the bird traits mentioned: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and lay eggs with shells. \n\nOption A describes black howler monkeys, which do not have feathers, wings, or lay eggs with shells, so they do not fit the criteria for being classified as birds.\n",

    "12161": "The answer is A. Igneous.\n\nGranodiorite is an igneous rock that forms through the cooling of melted rock. It is composed of various minerals, including biotite, feldspar, and quartz, which can be seen as distinct grains within the rock. The presence of these mineral grains indicates that granodiorite is an intrusive igneous rock, meaning it formed deep within the Earth's crust as magma cooled slowly over time. Metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, form from the transformation of pre-existing rocks under high pressure and temperature conditions, while sedimentary rocks are formed by the accumulation and cementation of sediments. Therefore, based on its formation process, granodiorite is classified as an igneous rock.\n",
    "12164": "The answer is A.\n\nWhen Trevor decides to join the Photography Club, spending more time in the Photography Club than he would have spent in the Theater Club would be considered a cost because it means he is giving up time that could have been spent on other activities or pursuits. This trade-off between time spent in one club versus another is a common consideration when making decisions about extracurricular activities. On the other hand, having more fun in the Photography Club than he would have had in the Theater Club would be considered a benefit or positive outcome of joining the Photography Club.\n",

Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 32 u and the average particle speed is 1,100 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 16 u and the average particle speed is 910 m/s.\n\nWe can use the formula for kinetic energy, KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity of the particle. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can compare the kinetic energies by comparing the products of the masses and velocities squared.\n\nFor Sample A:\nKE_A = 0.5 * 32 u * (1,100 m/s)^2\n\nFor Sample B:\nKE_B = 0.5 * 16 u * (910 m/s)^2\n\nSince the mass of each particle in Sample A is greater than the mass of each particle in Sample B, and the average particle speed in Sample A is also greater than the average particle speed in Sample B, it follows that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B.\n\nTherefore, Sample A has the higher temperature.\n",

Therefore, 19\u00b0C would be an appropriate estimate for the temperature inside a freezer. On the other hand, 19\u00b0F is closer to room temperature or slightly above it, making it an inaccurate estimate for the temperature inside a freezer.\n",
    "13683": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Breaking a ceramic plate involves a change in the shape of the plate without altering its fundamental composition or properties. This is considered a physical change because no new substances are formed.\n- Picking up a paper clip with a magnet involves the attraction between the magnetic material in the magnet and the metal in the paper clip. This interaction does not create any new substances; it merely rearranges the existing materials. Therefore, this is also a physical change.\n\nBoth scenarios involve changes that do not result in the formation of new substances, making them both physical changes. Options B, C, and D are incorrect as they describe processes that either involve heating, cooling, or the formation of new substances, which are not applicable to the given examples.\n",

    "13694": "The answer is A. The water, the gravel, the snails, and the worms make up the ecosystem in the Great Lakes. An ecosystem includes all living organisms and nonliving components within a specific area. In this case, the water, gravel, snails, and worms are all part of the environment where the lake sturgeon and walleye live and interact with each other. The lake sturgeon and walleye are also part of the ecosystem, but they are not the only components. Therefore, option A is the best description of an ecosystem in the Great Lakes.\n",
    "13697": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Although she left her house early, Lola barely made it to the train station in time,\" there is an independent clause (\"Lola barely made it to the train station in time\") and a dependent clause (\"Although she left her house early\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the result) and another idea that provides additional information or a reason (the cause). Option A is a simple sentence as it only contains one independent clause without any dependent clauses.\n",
    "13699": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample B. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in mass between the particles in each sample will affect their average kinetic energy. The average kinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Therefore, since the particles in Sample A have a greater mass, they will have a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature compared to the particles in Sample B.\n",

    "13778": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is shorter than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be stronger than the force between the magnets in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.\n",
    "13783": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nSteve has naturally curly hair, which suggests that it is an inherited trait. Curly hair is often determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to their offspring. If Steve's parents also have naturally curly hair, it is likely that he inherited the gene responsible for this trait from them. However, if his parents have naturally straight hair, it could be possible that Steve inherited a different gene combination that results in curly hair. Regardless, the fact that Steve has naturally curly hair indicates that it is an inherited trait rather than something he acquired through environmental factors or lifestyle choices.\n",

    "14712": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., won him a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects,\" there is an independent clause (\"Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\") and a dependent clause (\"won him a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the design won a medal) and one subordinate idea (the design was of the Lincoln Memorial). Option A is a simple sentence as it only contains one independent clause without any dependent clauses.\n",
    "14720": "The answer is A. False causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other. The text assumes that companies making huge profits must be exploiting their customers without providing evidence or a logical connection between the two. This is an example of assuming causation where there may not be any causal relationship between the two events mentioned.",
    "14721": "The answer is B. 4\u00b0C. \n\nThis is because the temperature of the air inside a refrigerator is typically around 4\u00b0C or 40\u00b0F, which is cold enough to keep food items fresh but not so cold as to freeze them. This temperature is maintained by the refrigerator's cooling system to ensure that the food remains safe to eat and does not spoil.",
    "14726": "The answer is B. Climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in an area, while weather describes short-term conditions like temperature, precipitation, and wind. The statement \"winter is the rainiest season of the year\" is describing a long-term pattern, so it is referring to the climate.",
    "14730": "The answer is A. Neither; the samples have the same temperature.\n\nExplanation: Since both samples have the same mass of each particle and the same average particle speed, their average kinetic energies will be equal.

Conversely, when an object has less thermal energy, its particles move slower and have lower kinetic energy, leading to a lower temperature. Therefore, the cookie with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature compared to the other cookie.",
    "15801": "The answer is C. Guilt by association is a logical fallacy where a person or idea is discredited because they are associated with something or someone else that is considered undesirable or wrong. In this case, the argument is that since no one is born writing plays like Shakespeare did, he must have had formal schooling. This is an attempt to discredit the idea that Shakespeare could have learned to write plays without formal schooling by associating it with the notion that only those who have formal education can write plays.",

    "15816": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred from the fact that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "15823": "The answer is A. The poem \"The sky is low, the clouds are mean,\" by Emily Dickinson, uses alliteration with the repetition of the 'l' sound in words like \"low,\" \"clouds,\" \"mean,\" and \"through.\" This creates a musical effect and helps to emphasize the somber mood of the poem.",
    "15830": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use a comma after the salutation. Therefore, option B, \"Dear Aunt Sarah,\" is the correct choice. Option A, \"dear Aunt Sarah,\" omits the comma, which is considered incorrect in standard English grammar for formal correspondence.\n",
    "15838": "The answer is B. The passage describes the weather because it refers to a specific event that occurred recently (over a week), which is characteristic of short-term weather conditions rather than long-term climate patterns.",
    "15851": "The answer is B. \n\nDavid's test using sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof allowed him to measure the amount of sunlight each side received over a single sunny day. This data would help him determine which side of the roof received more sunlight during that particular day, enabling him to make an informed decision about where to install the solar panels to maximize their efficiency and minimize costs for his client.\n",
    "15865": "The answer is C. Solution A.\n\nIn Solution A, there are three purple particles in a solvent volume of 25 mL, while in Solution B, there are only two purple particles in the same solvent volume. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles than Solution B.\n",

    "15870": "The answer is A.\n\nTessa wants to investigate how fabric affects the warming of an object. She has two shirts, one black and one white, and two identical empty glass jars. With these supplies, she can set up an experiment where she places each shirt around a glass jar and then measures the temperature of the jars using thermometers. By comparing the temperatures of the jars wrapped in the black shirt versus the white shirt, Tessa can determine if the color of the fabric affects how much the jars warm up in the sun. This experiment directly addresses the question of whether a black cotton shirt or a white cotton shirt will cause a glass jar to heat up more when placed in the sun.\n",
    "15873": "The answer is C.\n",
    "15878": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nThis is because Rick's naturally straight hair is likely due to his genetic makeup, which is passed down from his parents. Since the trait is present in him, it can be inferred that he inherited it from one or both of his parents who also have naturally straight hair. This is an example of a genetically determined trait, as opposed to an acquired trait, which would be something that develops over time through experiences or environmental factors rather than being present at birth.",
    "15884": "The answer is B. Joel's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes. This suggests that Joel inherited the trait of having hazel eyes from his father, as the trait is likely to be passed down through genetic inheritance. The other options do not provide evidence of genetic inheritance, as they either involve unrelated individuals or do not directly relate to the trait being discussed.\n",
    "15892": "The answer is B. 325 milliliters. \n\nThis is because a standard can of soda pop typically holds around 325 milliliters of liquid. Liters are generally used to measure larger volumes, such as those found in water bottles or large containers, while milliliters are more commonly used for smaller quantities like beverages in cans or bottles. Therefore, option B provides a more accurate estimate for the volume of a can of soda pop.",
    "15910": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the information provided, Oliver has two alleles for curled ears, which means he has the genotype EE.

    "15937": "The answer is A. huntsman spider.\n\nExplanation: The huntsman spider is an arachnid that is known for its ability to blend into its surroundings, including green leaves. This adaptation helps it to avoid predators and to ambush prey. The green mantis in the image is another example of an animal that is adapted to be camouflaged among green leaves, as it has a similar coloration and shape to the leaves it inhabits. However, the question specifically asks for an animal that is also adapted to be camouflaged among green leaves, so the correct answer would be the huntsman spider.\n",
    "15944": "The answer is D. This sentence is an example of a compound-complex sentence because it contains both a compound sentence (Jerry sat down on the rickety old chair and it abruptly collapsed beneath him) and a complex sentence (the entire sentence). The compound part consists of two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"and,\" while the complex part includes a dependent clause (\"it abruptly collapsed beneath him\") that modifies the main clause.",

    "15970": "The answer is B. Namaqua chameleon.\n\nThe Namaqua chameleon is known for its ability to blend into the sandy desert environment due to its coloration and texture. It has a light brown or tan color that helps it camouflage itself among the sand dunes and rocks. This adaptation allows the Namaqua chameleon to avoid predators and hunt more effectively by blending in with its surroundings. On the other hand, the polar bear is adapted to the cold Arctic environment and is not typically found in sandy deserts.\n",
    "15973": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and water and melting wax both involve changes in the state or form of matter without altering its fundamental composition. Mixing sand and water results in a mixture where the sand particles are suspended in the water, but they remain distinct entities. Similarly, melting wax involves changing the solid wax into a liquid wax, but the wax molecules themselves do not undergo any chemical transformation; they simply change their arrangement due to increased temperature. Therefore, both processes are classified as physical changes because no new substances are created, and the original properties of the materials involved are preserved.",
    "15974": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Ben's parents had the trait of straight hair and passed it down genetically to Ben, indicating that Ben inherited the trait from them. Option A does not provide any information about the genetic inheritance of the trait, as it only mentions that Ben and his father both have short hair, which does not necessarily imply that they inherited the trait from each other or from their parents.",

    "15992": "The answer is B. Albany.\n",
    "15994": "The answer is A. The trait of naturally brown hair is typically considered an inherited trait, as it is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to offspring. While environmental factors can influence hair color, such as sun exposure or certain medications, the natural color of one's hair is generally a result of their genetic makeup.",
    "15996": "The answer is B. Mateo can trade his tomatoes for Austin's broccoli.\n\nBased on the images provided, Mateo wants broccoli in his lunch while Austin is hoping for tomatoes. Therefore, if they were to trade, Mateo would give Austin his tomatoes in exchange for Austin's broccoli. This way, both Mateo and Austin would get what they want, making them happier with their lunches.\n",
    "15997": "The answer is A.\n\nDuring this time, thermal energy was transferred from each vial to the surroundings. This can be inferred from the fact that the initial temperatures of both vials were the same, but their final temperatures increased. This indicates that heat was added to the vials, causing their temperatures to rise. Since the vials were placed in different environments (one in the refrigerator and one on the counter), it is likely that the surrounding environment had a higher temperature than the vials themselves. Therefore, thermal energy was transferred from the vials to the surroundings as they absorbed heat from their environment.\n",

This means that Buddhism began approximately 1,100 years before Islam, making option A the correct statement. Option B is incorrect because Buddhism began about 1,300 years after Judaism, not 300 years.\n",
    "16036": "The answer is B. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. The magnetic force decreases as the distance between the magnets increases, so the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker than the force between the magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "16044": "The answer is A.\n\nNembrotha megalocera is an animal, and animals cannot make their own food. They must consume other organisms or organic matter to obtain the nutrients they need to survive. This process is known as heterotrophy, where animals obtain their energy by consuming other organisms or organic matter. In contrast, plants and some other organisms can produce their own food through photosynthesis, which is a process in which they use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create glucose, a type of sugar that serves as their primary source of energy. Therefore, Nembrotha megalocera cells cannot make their own food.\n",
    "16054": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"Brad asked for a rematch after Daniel beat him in tennis,\" the pronoun \"him\" could refer to either Brad or Daniel, making it unclear who Brad is asking for a rematch with.

    "16085": "The answer is B.\n\nThe magnets will repel each other because they both have opposite poles facing each other. The north pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other magnet, which creates a repulsive force between them. This is due to the fact that opposite poles of a magnet attract each other while like poles repel each other. Therefore, the magnets in the image will repel each other.\n",
    "16092": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"Ed's brother Bill wondered whether Ed ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon,\" the pronoun \"Ed\" is used as a reference to both \"Ed's brother Bill\" and \"Ed.\" This creates ambiguity because it is unclear whether Bill or Ed is the one who ran fast enough to qualify for the marathon. To avoid this confusion, it would be clearer to specify which person is being referred to by using a clear pronoun or noun phrase. For example, \"Ed's brother Bill wondered whether he ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon\" or \"Ed's brother Bill wondered whether his brother Ed ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon.\"\n",
    "16094": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the graph, it can be observed that the average monthly precipitation in Boston remains relatively consistent between May and October, with values ranging from approximately 2 inches to 4 inches per month.

    "16165": "The answer is B. To move the wagon at the same speed each time, Chase needs to pull with a larger force on the friend who weighs more. Since a friend weighing 23 pounds is heavier than one weighing 21 pounds, Chase would need to exert more force to pull the heavier friend at the same speed as pulling the lighter friend. This is because the force required to overcome friction and move an object is proportional to its weight or mass. Therefore, the friend who weighs 23 pounds requires a greater force to be pulled at the same speed compared to the friend who weighs 21 pounds.",

Therefore, option B, 9 kilograms, is a more reasonable estimate for the mass of a vacuum cleaner compared to option A, 9 grams.",
    "16184": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Breaking a plate involves a change in the shape of the plate without altering its fundamental composition or properties, making it a physical change. Water evaporating from a lake also represents a physical change as water transitions from a liquid to a gas state without changing its chemical composition. Neither process involves the formation of new substances or the breaking down of existing ones, which would be characteristic of a chemical change. Therefore, both events are classified as physical changes.",

    "16189": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn this case, Sample A has particles with a mass of 30 u and an average speed of 1,600 m/s, while Sample B has particles with a mass of 26 u and an average speed of 1,400 m/s. Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, but their average speeds are also greater, it is difficult to determine which sample has the higher average kinetic energy without more information.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, we can see that the average speed of the particles in Sample A is higher than the average speed of the particles in Sample B. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature compared to Sample B.\n",

    "16498": "The answer is A. Hyla japonica.\n\nExplanation: The gray tree frog's scientific name is Hyla versicolor. The genus of an organism is the first part of its scientific name. Therefore, the genus of the gray tree frog is Hyla. Hyla japonica also belongs to the genus Hyla, making it the correct answer. Bufo guttatus and Atelopus zeteki belong to different genera, so they are not the correct answers.\n",
    "16508": "The answer is A. According to Newton's third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, if Isaac is pushing on his friend's wheelchair, the wheelchair must also be pushing back on Isaac with an equal force. This is because the force exerted by Isaac on the wheelchair is an action, and the force exerted by the wheelchair on Isaac is the reaction that balances it out.",
    "16514": "The answer is A. Bald ibis.\n\nThe image shows a large ground finch with a beak that is adapted to crack open small, hard seeds. The beak is strong and sturdy, which allows it to break through the tough outer shell of the seeds. This adaptation is common among birds that feed on seeds, as it helps them access the nutrients they need to survive.\n\nWhile the Asian golden weaver is another type of bird, its beak is not adapted to crack hard seeds.

Therefore, option A is the correct choice for showing the title of a movie.",
    "17010": "The answer is C. Bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct. \n\nIn this case, the argument suggests that since the local government is advising everyone to remove standing water, and the neighbors are not doing it, there is no reason for them to do so either. This is an example of the bandwagon fallacy because it assumes that because the majority of people are not doing something, it must be wrong or unnecessary for them to do it as well. It does not consider other factors such as personal health risks or environmental concerns that might make it important for them to follow the advice given by the local government.\n",
    "17011": "The answer is A.\n",
    "17016": "The answer is B. The word \"strain\" would not be found between the guide words \"shape\" and \"spray\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range.

It is much smaller than 2 cups (which is approximately 16 fluid ounces) or 2 gallons (which is 128 fluid ounces).",
    "17028": "The answer is B.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn the given diagram, Sample A has particles with an average speed of 1,500 m/s, while Sample B has particles with an average speed of 1,400 m/s. Since the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the difference in their average speeds indicates that the particles in Sample A have more kinetic energy than those in Sample B.\n\nTherefore, Sample A has the higher temperature because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy.\n",
    "17029": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"Sidney was known among her coworkers for her spartan ways\" refers to the Spartan people, who were known for their simplicity and austerity.

    "17791": "The answer is C. Neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nIn the given diagram, both Solution A and Solution B have the same volume of solvent (30 mL). However, the number of pink particles in each solution is different. Solution A contains three pink particles, while Solution B contains only two pink particles. Since the concentration of a solution is determined by the ratio of solute particles to the total volume of the solution, we can calculate the concentration of each solution as follows:\n\nConcentration of Solution A = Number of pink particles / Volume of solvent\n= 3 pink particles / 30 mL\n= 0.1 particles/mL\n\nConcentration of Solution B = Number of pink particles / Volume of solvent\n= 2 pink particles / 30 mL\n= 0.067 particles/mL\n\nComparing the concentrations of the two solutions, we see that Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles than Solution B. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Solution A.\n",

    "18186": "The answer is B.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn this case, Sample A has particles with a mass of 46 u and an average speed of 1,300 m/s, while Sample B has particles with a mass of 44 u and an average speed of 1,200 m/s. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can compare their average kinetic energies by multiplying the mass of each particle by the square of its average speed:\n\nSample A: 46 u * (1,300 m/s)^2 = 78,920,000 u*m^2/s^2\nSample B: 44 u * (1,200 m/s)^2 = 63,360,000 u*m^2/s^2\n\nSince Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy than Sample B, it follows that Sample A has the higher temperature.\n",
    "18190": "The answer is C. \n\nTo determine the temperature shown by the thermometer, you need to look at the scale and the position of the mercury or liquid column within the thermometer. In this case, the mercury line aligns with the 50\u00b0F mark on the scale, indicating that the temperature is 50\u00b0F. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",
    "18200": "The answer is A.\n",
    "18201": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature because it has a higher average particle speed compared to Sample B. Since the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to their average speed. Therefore, the sample with the higher average particle speed will have the higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.\n",

The poem by Gordon Bottomley, \"To Iron-Founders and Others,\" uses alliteration with words like \"blade,\" \"grass,\" \"poison,\" \"England,\" \"roots,\" \"man,\" \"foot,\" and \"green.\" Alliteration is the repetition of initial consonant sounds within a sentence or phrase to create a musical effect and emphasize certain words or ideas. In contrast, the poem by Charlotte Bront\u00eb does not use alliteration as it does not repeat any initial consonant sounds within its lines.\n",
    "18228": "The answer is C. neither; the samples have the same temperature.\n\nExplanation: Since both samples have the same mass of each particle and the same average particle speed, their average kinetic energies will be equal. Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, since the average kinetic energies of the particles in both samples are equal, they have the same temperature.\n",
    "18232": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"The price went up, so Jane will have to save more money,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" This makes it a compound sentence because each clause can stand alone as a complete thought.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
    "18798": "The answer is B.\n",
    "18800": "The answer is A. Ll.\n\nThis is because the plant has one allele for fuzzy leaves (L) and one allele for smooth leaves (l). Since the allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l), the presence of even one dominant allele (L) will result in the expression of the fuzzy leaf phenotype. Therefore, the genotype of the plant is Ll, indicating that it has one dominant allele (L) and one recessive allele (l) for the leaf texture trait.",
    "18810": "The answer is B. With the given supplies, Roger can investigate whether squirrels prefer sunflower seeds or walnuts by setting up two identical feeders, one containing sunflower seeds and the other containing walnuts. By observing and recording how many times each type of food is collected, he can determine if there is a preference between the two types of seeds and nuts.

    "18947": "The answer is C. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: Cooking an egg involves a chemical change where the proteins in the egg white denature, changing their structure and making them solid. An antacid tablet reacting with water also involves a chemical reaction, as the tablet releases carbon dioxide gas and other substances that neutralize stomach acid. Neither of these processes can be described as purely physical changes or cooling, so options B and D are incorrect. Heating is involved in cooking an egg but not in the reaction between an antacid tablet and water, so option A is also incorrect. Therefore, both processes involve chemical changes.\n",
    "18951": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond. This means that the forces acting on Desmond are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net force of zero. Since the net force is zero, Desmond remains stationary or moves at a constant velocity, as per Newton's first law of motion. In this case, the forces of gravity pulling downwards and the diving board pushing upwards are equal, causing no acceleration and maintaining Desmond's position on the diving board.",
    "18952": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Paul did not inherently know how to identify different fish but rather had to learn this skill, indicating that he acquired the ability to identify fish through experience or education. This aligns with the concept of a learned trait, as opposed to an innate one. Option A does not provide evidence of Paul acquiring the trait; it only states that he has pet fish, which could be related to his interest in fish but does not necessarily imply that he has developed the skill to identify them.",

    "18982": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and water and a rock heating up in a campfire both involve changes that can be reversed without altering the fundamental composition of the substances involved. Mixing sand and water results in a mixture where the sand particles are suspended in the water, but they can be separated back into their original forms. Similarly, heating a rock in a campfire causes it to change temperature, but it does not alter its chemical composition or structure. Therefore, both scenarios represent physical changes rather than chemical ones, as no new substances are created or old substances are destroyed during the process.",

The metaphor suggests that despite the negative situation of losing his job, there was a positive aspect or opportunity for Connor to pursue a new career, which could be seen as a light in the midst of the darkness caused by the job loss. This implies that even though the initial situation was difficult, it presented an opportunity for growth and change.\n",
    "18989": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Francesca.\n\nTo explain further, in physics, a net force is the sum of all the forces acting on an object. If the net force is zero, then the forces are said to be balanced, meaning that the object will remain at rest or continue moving at a constant velocity. In this case, the force of gravity pulling Francesca down is 600N, and the force of the seat pushing her up is 1,200N. Since these two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. Therefore, the forces on Francesca are balanced, and there is no net force acting on her. This means that she will continue to move at a constant velocity along the path of the roller coaster, assuming no other forces act upon her.\n",

The low temperatures and limited precipitation make it difficult for large trees to grow, so the vegetation is mostly small plants such as grasses, shrubs, and mosses. This type of ecosystem is known as a tundra, characterized by its cold climate and sparse vegetation. Therefore, option A better describes the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem.\n",
    "19113": "The answer is B. The object with the lower temperature will have less thermal energy. Since the 350-gram cup of black tea at 110\u00b0F has a lower temperature than the one at 195\u00b0F, it will have less thermal energy.",
    "19119": "The answer is B. The sentence uses a simile because it compares the heat in the attic to that of an oven using the word \"like.\" A simile explicitly states the comparison between two things by using words such as \"like\" or \"as,\" while a metaphor directly states the comparison without using these words.",
    "19129": "The answer is C. A banana at a temperature of 92\u00b0F has the most thermal energy because it is the warmest among the three options provided.

    "19950": "The answer is B. Allusion. The text makes a reference to Benedict Arnold, a historical figure known for his betrayal during the American Revolutionary War. By calling Logan a \"real Benedict Arnold,\" the author is using an allusion to suggest that Logan has betrayed their trust or commitment, similar to how Benedict Arnold famously betrayed the American cause by switching sides to the British. This comparison uses a well-known historical event to make a point about Logan's actions.",

    "19954": "The answer is A. Ethos (character).\n\nThe advertisement uses the ethos appeal by presenting the Ashton-Baker Credit Union as an institution that has been protecting people's money since 1902. This establishes the company's credibility and trustworthiness, which is important for financial institutions. By emphasizing their long history of protecting customers' money, the ad aims to build confidence in the credit union and encourage potential customers to choose them for their financial needs.\n",
    "19958": "The answer is E. 2:2\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are Ee. This means that all of the offspring will have one dominant allele (E) and one recessive allele (e). Since the allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e), all of the offspring will have curled ears. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4 or 0:4.",

    "19980": "The answer is C. Oregon.\n",
    "19982": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where Tessa is being discredited based on her friends' actions rather than any evidence directly linking her to starting the food fight. This is an attempt to discredit her character by associating her with her friends' behavior, even though there is no direct evidence connecting her to the incident.\n",
    "19983": "The answer is B.\n\nThe magnets will attract each other because opposite poles attract. In the image, one magnet has its north pole facing the south pole of the other magnet, and vice versa. This means that the north pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other magnet, which will cause them to attract each other.\n",
    "19992": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use a comma after the salutation. Therefore, option A, \"Dear Josie,\" is the correct choice. Option B, \"dear Josie,\" omits the comma, which is considered incorrect in standard English grammar for formal correspondence.\n",
    "19994": "The answer is B. Purple Gallinule. \n\nThe purple gallinule is a type of bird that lives in wetlands and marshes, where it feeds on aquatic plants and small animals. It has long, slender legs with webbed toes, which allow it to walk on floating vegetation such as lily pads and reeds. This adaptation allows the purple gallinule to move easily through the water and find food in its natural habitat. The jacana, on the other hand, is a type of wading bird that lives in tropical and subtropical regions, where it feeds on insects and snails that live on floating plants. Its long, thin legs and sharp claws help it to walk on the leaves without sinking into the water, but they are not specifically adapted for walking on floating vegetation like the purple gallinule's feet are.\n",
    "19996": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"It\" could refer to either \"Olivia's community garden project\" or \"her community garden project.\" This creates ambiguity because the pronoun \"it\" does not clearly indicate which specific project is being referred to. In contrast, option B clearly states that \"She\" refers to Olivia, making the sentence less ambiguous.\n",
    "19999": "The answer is D. Oklahoma City.\n",
    "20000": "The answer is B. The idiom \"Arianna has a lot on her plate\" suggests that Arianna has many responsibilities or tasks to manage, similar to how a plate can be full of food, indicating that there is much to handle. In this case, it implies that Arianna is juggling multiple commitments such as attending college, working, and volunteering, all of which require her time and effort.",
    "20014": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring: AA, Aa, Aa, and aa. Since the allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a), all of the offspring will have at least one A allele and therefore will have a spotted coat. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a black coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 0:4.\n",
    "20023": "The answer is B. Ferrous oxide is a compound because it consists of two different elements, iron (Fe) and oxygen (O), bonded together in a specific ratio. An elementary substance, on the other hand, contains only one type of atom.",

    "20027": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"literally\" is used in its traditional sense to mean \"actually\" or \"in fact,\" indicating that the bridge is actually hundreds of years old rather than figuratively. Option A uses \"literally\" in a hyperbolic manner, suggesting that the bridge is millions of years old, which is not accurate and is an exaggeration. Therefore, option B is the correct choice as it uses the word \"literally\" in its traditional sense.",
    "20028": "The answer is D. Bison is a living thing, while brick wall, the Statue of Liberty, and rainboot are inanimate objects or man-made structures.",
    "20030": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by observing that the magnets in Pair 1 are smaller than those in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets depends on their size and distance apart, it is generally stronger when the magnets are larger or closer together. Therefore, the smaller magnets in Pair 1 would exert a weaker magnetic force compared to the larger magnets in Pair 2.\n",
    "20038": "The answer is A.\n",
    "20048": "The answer is B. 1,145 liters.\n\nKiddie pools are typically much larger than 1,145 milliliters, as that would be equivalent to only about one liter or slightly more. A standard kiddie pool can hold anywhere from 200 to 500 gallons of water, which translates to approximately 757 to 1,893 liters. Therefore, option B, 1,145 liters, is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a kiddie pool compared to option A, 1,145 milliliters.\n",
    "20055": "The answer is A. Pennsylvania.\n",
    "20056": "The answer is A. The helicopter has a constant velocity because it is moving directly upward at a constant speed. Velocity is defined as the rate of change of position with respect to time, and since the helicopter is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, its velocity remains unchanged. Acceleration, on the other hand, refers to a change in velocity over time, so if the helicopter were accelerating, its velocity would be changing. Since the helicopter's velocity is constant, it is not accelerating.",
    "20058": "The answer is C. Tucker's sister taught him how to do tricks with a jump rope. This option directly indicates that Tucker learned the skill from someone else, which supports the conclusion that he acquired the trait of knowing how to do tricks with a jump rope. Options A and B do not provide evidence of Tucker learning the skill; they only describe his possession of multiple jump ropes or his success in a competition, respectively.\n",
    "20061": "The answer is A. The colder soap bubble has less thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object possesses. Higher temperatures indicate more kinetic energy in the particles that make up the object, resulting in higher thermal energy. Therefore, the colder soap bubble would have less thermal energy compared to the hotter one.\n",
    "20064": "The answer is C.\n",
    "20069": "The answer is B. Des Moines.\n",
    "20070": "The answer is B. Since both objects have the same mass (125 grams), the one with the lower temperature (75\u00b0F) will have less thermal energy compared to the one with the higher temperature (85\u00b0F). Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; as the temperature increases, so does the thermal energy. Therefore, the 125-gram glass of grape juice at 75\u00b0F has less thermal energy than the one at 85\u00b0F.\n",
    "20074": "The answer is A.\n\nIn this experiment, the experimental group refers to the group that receives the treatment or manipulation being tested. In this case, Justine applied wax to the underside of one snowboard and then rode it down a hill. This snowboard with wax added is considered the experimental group because it received the treatment (application of wax). The other snowboards, which did not receive any wax and were ridden without wax, are considered the control group since they did not receive the treatment being tested.\n",
    "20079": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"them\" is a vague pronoun reference because it is unclear to whom \"them\" refers. It could be referring to Josh or someone else entirely. Option A does not have a vague pronoun reference as \"the registrar's office\" clearly indicates who the transcript was sent to.",
    "20089": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Clare wants fortune cookies, but Alvin would rather have pie,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction \"but.\" This makes it a compound sentence. Option A is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause.\n",

    "20098": "The answer is B. The word \"blubber\" would not be found between the guide words \"barn\" and \"beetle\" because it starts with the letter \"b,\" but it does not fall within the range of letters that would be between these two words in alphabetical order. Guide words help readers locate specific entries quickly by indicating the first and last words on a page, so \"blubber\" would need to start with a letter that comes after \"b\" in the alphabet, such as \"c\" or later.",

A paradox is a statement or situation that appears to contradict itself or defy logic, yet it can be true in certain contexts. Here, the speaker is suggesting that Jennifer's statement is self-defeating because saying \"never\" implies an absolute certainty, which is often difficult to maintain over time. The speaker is implying that things change, so Jennifer's statement might not hold true in the future. This creates a paradoxical situation where the statement contradicts itself due to the passage of time and potential changes in circumstances.\n",

(B) Hinduism began about 1,500 years before Christianity. (C) Hinduism began about 500 years before Judaism.\nAnswer: The answer is B.\n\nContext: Read the text about okapis.\nWhen you first see an okapi, you might think it's related to a horse or a zebra. Its body and neck are horse-like, and its legs have black-and-white stripes like a zebra does. But the okapi is not related to a horse or a zebra; its closest relative is actually the giraffe. In fact, okapis are sometimes called forest giraffes, since they live mainly in the rain forests of central Africa.\nAn okapi's relationship to a giraffe is most noticeable in its face. Like giraffes, okapis have long, thin faces topped with large, upward-pointing ears. Male okapis also have little furry horns like giraffes' horns. Additionally, both giraffes and okapis have long, dark tongues, which can grab and strip leaves from trees. And just like giraffes, okapis are plant eaters, feeding on leaves, buds, twigs, and fruit.\nIn many ways, though, okapis are quite different from their giraffe cousins. An okapi's neck is much shorter than a giraffe's. This is useful, because a long neck would make it difficult to move through thick vegetation.",

    "20547": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of the particles. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in temperature will be determined by the difference in the masses of the particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 28 u, while in Sample B, the mass of each particle is 44 u. Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, the particles in Sample B have more kinetic energy per unit mass compared to those in Sample A. Therefore, Sample B has a higher temperature than Sample A.\n",
    "20566": "The answer is C. 25 meters.\n\nThis is because a standard basketball court measures approximately 28 feet in length and 19 feet in width. To convert these measurements to meters, we can use the conversion factor that 1 foot is equal to 0.3048 meters. Therefore, the length of the court would be:\n\nLength = 28 feet * 0.3048 meters/foot \u2248 8.53 meters\n\nAnd the width of the court would be:\n\nWidth = 19 feet * 0.3048 meters/foot \u2248 5.84 meters\n\nSo, the total length of the court is approximately 8.53 meters + 5.84 meters = 14.37 meters. However, since the options provided are whole numbers, the closest option to the actual length of a basketball court is 25 meters. Therefore, the best estimate among the given options is 25 meters.\n",
