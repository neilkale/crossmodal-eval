    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\" Jackhammers are known for being extremely loud, so the phrase implies that Mr. Herrera's snoring is quite noisy.",
    "7": "The answer is B. Armored catfish. \n\nThe image shows a sturgeon with its mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward. While the question asks for an animal whose mouth is also adapted for bottom feeding, the image only provides information about the sturgeon. Therefore, we cannot determine if any other animal's mouth is adapted for bottom feeding based solely on the image provided. However, based on the context given, the armored catfish is known to be a bottom feeder and has a mouth adapted for this purpose.\n",
    "8": "The answer is A.\n\nThe given statement is not a complete sentence because it lacks a subject and a verb. It is missing the necessary components to express a complete thought or idea. A complete sentence should have a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what the subject does or is). In this case, the subject \"rock\" is present, but there is no verb indicating an action or state. Therefore, it is considered a sentence fragment.\n\nTo make it a complete sentence, one could add a verb such as \"was removed,\" resulting in: \"During the construction of Mount Rushmore, approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock was removed from the mountain to create the monument.\"\n",
    "13": "The answer is C.\n\nWendy's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This test was designed to determine whether adding extra nutrients to the bacteria would result in an increased production of insulin. Therefore, the test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin, as stated in option C.\n",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title format for a play, as it follows standard capitalization rules for titles, with each word capitalized except for articles, conjunctions, and prepositions unless they are the first or last word in the title.",
    "16": "The answer is B.\n",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene. Since the allele H is dominant over the allele h (which represents having horns), an individual with the genotype HH will express the dominant trait, which in this case is not having horns. However, because the question asks specifically about the horns trait, and given that the allele H is dominant over h, Daffodil would have the phenotype of \"having horns\" due to the dominance of the H allele.",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon.\n\nNew Zealand falcons are known for their sharp talons and hooked beaks, which are adaptations that allow them to grab and hold onto their prey effectively. These adaptations enable them to catch and consume a variety of small animals, including insects, lizards, and even other birds. While sables are also predators, they typically hunt for small mammals such as rodents and rabbits, and their feet are not specifically adapted for grabbing prey in the same way that New Zealand falcons' feet are.\n",
    "36": "The answer is A.\n",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.\n",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to give the raindrops a human-like action. \"Kissing\" the fans' cheeks is a more expressive and personified way to describe the rain falling on their faces compared to simply \"landing on\" them. This choice adds a touch of warmth and affection to the scene, as if the rain is gently caressing the fans with its droplets.",
    "52": "The answer is C. Earthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.\n",
    "55": "The answer is A.\n",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture.\n\nThe Cape vulture is a large bird of prey that is native to southern Africa. It has a hooked beak that is adapted to tearing through meat, as well as strong talons that it uses to catch and hold its prey. The Cape vulture is known for its scavenging behavior, and it often feeds on carrion, including dead animals such as deer, antelope, and other large mammals. Its diet also includes smaller animals such as insects, reptiles, and amphibians. The Cape vulture is a powerful predator that plays an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control the populations of other animals.\n",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" is said while observing an ancient pug that seems to sleep all day. This implies that the speaker is using sarcasm or contradiction to express that the pug is not energetic at all, but rather appears to be very relaxed and sleepy.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"the prodigal son returned home\" refers to the biblical story of the Prodigal Son, found in Luke 15:11-32. This story is a parable that illustrates God's love and forgiveness towards those who repent and return to Him. The term \"prodigal son\" is used here to describe Michael, who left his studies to travel the world but later returned home and resumed his education, symbolizing his return to a more responsible and mature state of life.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 20 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 75 to 230 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as it is closer to the actual capacity of a car's gas tank.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho is the state that is farthest north among the given options.\n",
    "74": "The answer is B. Austen learned how to build a fire at summer camp. This option provides a specific context or event where Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, supporting the conclusion that she learned this skill rather than it being an innate or pre-existing trait. Option A only states that Austen can cook food over a fire, which does not necessarily imply that she learned how to build the fire herself.",
    "77": "The answer is C.\n",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.",
    "81": "The answer is B.\n",
    "82": "The answer is B. Sturgeon's mouth is adapted for bottom feeding as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward, similar to the armored catfish. This adaptation allows them to easily access and consume food found at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. On the other hand, the clown triggerfish does not have an adapted mouth for bottom feeding; instead, it has a mouth that is adapted for eating small invertebrates and plants found in coral reefs.\n",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F, as it is more commonly used in everyday conversation to describe temperatures, especially in countries that use the Fahrenheit scale. 41\u00b0C would be considered very hot, while 41\u00b0F is closer to a comfortable temperature for most people.\n",
    "101": "The answer is B.\n",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is not shown to be consumed by any other organism, so it is likely a producer or decomposer rather than a consumer.\n",
    "113": "The answer is B. To determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: The ship moved 555 kilometers west in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 555 km / 10 hours = 55.5 km/h.\n- For option B: The ship moved 95 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 95 km / 10 hours = 9.5 km/h.\n- For option C: The ship moved 460 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 460 km / 10 hours = 46 km/h.\n\nComparing these speeds:\n- Option A: 55.5 km/h\n- Option B: 9.5 km/h\n- Option C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is the one in option B, which moved at 9.5 km/h. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur\" because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in an expression of short fur.\n",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. In this case, each part of the sentence expresses a complete thought:\n- \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud\" (independent clause)\n- \"we gave him a bath\" (independent clause)\n\nOption A, \"Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes,\" is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause. It does not have any conjunctions joining two or more independent clauses together.\n",
    "124": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: All of the offspring in the Punnett square have the genotype ee, which means they will all have black eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0.\n",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Rosa's father has brown eyes, indicating that he likely passed the brown eye trait to Rosa through genetic inheritance. This is a common way in which traits are inherited, where parents' genes contribute to their offspring's characteristics. However, it's important to note that while this is a plausible explanation, other factors such as environmental influences or mutations could also play a role in determining Rosa's eye color.",
    "148": "The answer is A.\n",
    "150": "The answer is B.\n",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, implying that Richard might also be involved in similar activities. This is an attempt to discredit him based on a negative association rather than on any evidence related to Richard himself.",
    "160": "The answer is B.\n",
    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction where the acid in the vinegar reacts with the copper oxide on the surface of the penny, converting it back to copper. This process changes the composition of the substance, making it a chemical change.",
    "165": "The answer is B.\n",
    "169": "The answer is A. The word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the first and last words on a page. If \"import\" were to appear in the dictionary, it would be placed after \"industry\" since it comes alphabetically after \"industry.\"",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion \"Midas touch\" refers to someone who is exceptionally skilled or fortunate in their endeavors, often implying that they can turn anything into gold. In this context, it suggests that Tyler is successful at everything he does, as he has been able to launch a thriving business and establish a respected charity without any special experience or training. This implies that Tyler possesses an exceptional ability or talent in various aspects of life.\n",
    "178": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and another idea that provides additional information or explanation (according to many scholars).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence. It has an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"although presidential elections take place in early November\").\n\nBoth options contain complex sentences, but since the question asks for a single example, either A or B would be correct. However, if we need to choose between them, option A is more straightforward as it doesn't include any conjunctions or other elements that might make it more complex than necessary.\n",

    "231": "The answer is B. Noah was upset about staying home.\n\nIn the given text, Noah uses verbal irony by saying that it was \"my good luck\" to have to study for a test while his friends went to the water park. This implies that he did not consider studying as a fortunate event, but rather an unpleasant one. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Noah was upset about having to stay home instead of going to the water park with his friends.",
    "240": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Cooking a pancake involves the chemical reaction between the ingredients, such as flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder, to form a new substance (the pancake). This process also involves the Maillard reaction, which is a complex series of chemical reactions that occur during cooking, leading to the development of flavor and color in the pancake.\n- Rusting on a bicycle frame is another example of a chemical change. It occurs due to the oxidation of iron in the presence of moisture and oxygen, resulting in the formation of rust (iron oxide).\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions that transform the original substances into new substances with different properties, making them chemical changes rather than physical changes.",

It is known for its distinctive appearance, with a bright red body and a green head. Like the scarlet macaw, the Alexandrine parakeet has a strong, curved beak that is adapted to crack open large, hard nuts. This adaptation allows it to access the nutritious seeds and nuts that make up a significant part of its diet. The blue rock pigeon, on the other hand, is a small bird that is native to Europe and Asia. Its beak is not as strong or curved as that of the Alexandrine parakeet, and it is not adapted to crack open large, hard nuts. Instead, it has a more pointed beak that is better suited for pecking at seeds and insects.\n",

The forces acting on Kylie are unbalanced because the seat of the cart is pushing up on her with a force of 1,200N while Earth's gravity is pulling down on her with a force of 600N. Since these forces are in opposite directions and one is greater than the other, there is a net force acting on Kylie, causing her to accelerate upwards towards the top of the loop.",
    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "664": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since the strength of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets and the orientation of their poles, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs as long as the distance between the magnets remains constant. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

The Chinese alligators, on the other hand, do not have wings or a beak, and their eggs do not have shells, so they do not meet the criteria for being classified as birds.",
    "818": "The answer is C. The information that Pablo's scar was caused by an accident, specifically when he cut his leg while falling off his skateboard, supports the conclusion that Pablo acquired the scar as a result of an event or incident rather than inheriting it genetically or having it since birth. This indicates that the scar is a new trait that Pablo developed due to the accident, rather than being a pre-existing characteristic.\n",
    "821": "The answer is A. The poem \"Down, down, down!\" by Alice Ruth Moore uses repetition with the phrase \"Down, down, down!\" repeated three times, creating a sense of movement and rhythm. This repetition helps to emphasize the downward motion of the mermaid as she descends into the depths of the sea. On the other hand, the poem \"The Poor Old Year Died Hard\" by Matthew Arnold does not use any repetition. Instead, it employs imagery and figurative language to describe the end of the year and the arrival of winter.",
    "825": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Paul, its height relative to the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external forces other than gravity act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon does not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy is directly related to the increase in its kinetic energy due to the fall. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "829": "The answer is A.\n\nThe image shows a landscape with a large area covered in white ash, indicating that it was affected by a wildfire. The presence of white ash suggests that the fire burned through the vegetation, leaving behind a layer of ash as it spread across the area. This is a clear sign of a recent wildfire event. Option B is incorrect because there is no indication of green leaves on the trees in the image; instead, the trees appear to be dead or burnt due to the fire.\n",
    "837": "The answer is A. The passage describes the weather because it refers to the specific conditions observed in Manuel's location during a particular time period (last week). Weather involves the short-term atmospheric conditions at a given place, such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and precipitation. In contrast, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a region, typically averaged over many years. Since the passage mentions cumulus clouds every day last week, it is describing the short-term atmospheric conditions, which aligns with the definition of weather.",
    "838": "The answer is B. The circulatory system helps remove carbon dioxide waste from the body by transporting it to the lungs where it can be exhaled. It also delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells throughout the body and removes cellular waste products. While the digestive system breaks down food into small pieces, that is not a function of the circulatory system.",
    "839": "The answer is B.\n\nGranodiorite is not a mineral because it does not have a fixed crystal structure, which is one of the defining characteristics of minerals. Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and an ordered internal structure. Granodiorite, on the other hand, is a type of igneous rock that forms from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. It is composed of various minerals, but it does not have a single, consistent chemical composition or a fixed crystal structure throughout its entire volume. Therefore, granodiorite is not classified as a mineral.\n",

    "2088": "The answer is B. Apostrophe is a figure of speech where a person or thing is addressed directly as if it were alive and capable of understanding. In this case, Lord Byron is addressing the ocean as if it were a living being, using an apostrophe to express his feelings towards it.",
    "2096": "The answer is B.\n\nCameron's test showed how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour. By observing the parachute in the wind tunnel, he could determine if the vent caused the parachute to swing too much at this speed. This information would help him decide if the vent size was appropriate for the spacecraft's landing on Mars. Option A is incorrect because Cameron did not test the effect of the vent on the spacecraft itself, but rather on the parachute. Option C is also incorrect because Cameron only tested the parachute at 200 km per hour, not at 400 km per hour.\n",

    "2352": "The answer is A. Inherited.\n\nThis is because Polly's naturally curly hair is likely due to her genetic makeup, which is passed down from her parents. Curly hair is often associated with certain genetic traits that can be inherited. If both of Polly's parents have naturally curly hair, it is more likely that she inherited the gene responsible for this trait. However, if only one parent has naturally curly hair, Polly may still have naturally curly hair due to the dominance of the gene in her case. It is important to note that hair texture can also be influenced by environmental factors such as diet, hair care practices, and exposure to sun and wind, but these factors typically do not cause a change in hair texture from one generation to the next. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be that Polly's naturally curly hair is an inherited trait.\n",

    "3137": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 because the magnets in Pair 2 are larger than the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic strength is proportional to their size. Therefore, the larger magnets in Pair 2 will exert a stronger magnetic force on each other compared to the smaller magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "3160": "The answer is D. Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn the case of carving a piece of wood, heat can be used to soften the wood temporarily, making it easier to carve. However, this is not the primary cause of the change; rather, it is a tool or method used to facilitate the change. \n\nFor water boiling on a stove, the primary cause of the change is the application of heat energy, which causes the water molecules to gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces holding them together, resulting in the water turning into vapor (steam). This is a physical change as no new substance is formed, but the state of matter changes from liquid to gas due to the increase in temperature and pressure.\n\nTherefore, both activities involve the use of heat to bring about a change, making option D the correct choice.",

    "3909": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Serengeti National Park is located in Tanzania, a country in eastern Africa. Eastern Africa experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, the area receives heavy rainfall, while during the dry season, there is little to no precipitation. This seasonal pattern affects the vegetation and wildlife in the region, as plants grow and animals migrate in response to the changing weather conditions.\n\nIn addition to the seasonal rainfall, the soil in the Serengeti National Park is generally poor in nutrients. This is due to the fact that the area experiences high temperatures and intense sunlight, which can cause rapid decomposition of organic matter and leaching of nutrients from the soil. As a result, the soil in the park is often low in fertility, which can limit the growth of certain plant species and affect the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, option B, \"It has a rainy season and a dry season.

Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 44 u and the average particle speed is 840 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average particle speed is 1,000 m/s.\n\nWe can use the formula for kinetic energy, KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity of the particle. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can compare the kinetic energies by comparing the products of the masses and velocities squared.\n\nFor Sample A:\nKE_A = 0.5 * 44 u * (840 m/s)^2\n\nFor Sample B:\nKE_B = 0.5 * 46 u * (1,000 m/s)^2\n\nSince the velocity of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, the product of the mass and velocity squared will be larger for Sample B.

    "5327": "The answer is C. Preston can investigate whether the pet lizard is more active when its tank is heated with one heating lamp or with two heating lamps using the available supplies. This experiment would help him understand if temperature affects the lizard's activity level. Options A and B involve feeding the lizard different types of food, which are not among the supplies provided. Therefore, option C is the most suitable choice for an experiment with the given resources.",
    "5330": "The answer is B. A cookie at a temperature of 29\u00b0C has the most thermal energy because it is the hottest among the three options provided. Thermal energy increases with temperature, so the object with the highest temperature will have the most thermal energy.",
    "5340": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 2 are smaller than the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force between two magnets depends on their size and distance apart, the smaller magnets in Pair 2 will exert a weaker magnetic force compared to the larger magnets in Pair 1. Therefore, the statement that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 is true.\n",
    "5344": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5345": "The answer is C. Complex.\n\nThis sentence is considered complex because it contains an independent clause (\"Since it takes approximately one thousand years for a used printer cartridge to decompose\") and a dependent clause (\"recycling these plastic ink dispensers helps the environment\"). The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence, but together they form a single, more complex thought or idea.",
    "5350": "The answer is A. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs because all the magnets are made of the same material and they are separated by the same distance. The orientation of the magnets does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force, only its direction.",
    "5353": "The answer is B. Silk is not a pure substance and it is made by living things, so it does not fit the definition of a mineral. Minerals are inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and crystalline structure, formed through natural processes.",
    "5357": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the diagram, the dinosaur footprint is located in the deeper layer of the sedimentary rock sequence, while the insect fossil is found in the shallower layer. Since the deeper layers are typically older than the shallower layers due to the process of sedimentation, it can be inferred that the dinosaur footprint is younger than the insect fossil.\n",
    "5360": "The answer is A. the bottles with lids kept on\n\nIn this experiment, the experimental group refers to the group that received the treatment or manipulation being tested. In this case, Steve manipulated the amount of carbon dioxide in the soda by leaving the lids off of some bottles to allow the carbon dioxide to escape, while keeping the lids on other bottles to retain the carbon dioxide. Therefore, the bottles with lids kept on were part of the experimental group because they received the treatment (retaining the carbon dioxide), while the bottles with lids taken off were part of the control group because they did not receive the treatment (allowing the carbon dioxide to escape).",
    "5368": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5369": "The answer is A. \"New York Law Journal\" is the correct title of a newspaper, as it follows proper capitalization rules and includes the city name in all capital letters.",
    "5376": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the food web, the snowy owl is shown to be a predator of the Arctic fox, which feeds on the bear sedge. Therefore, the snowy owl contains matter that was once part of the bear sedge.",
    "5377": "The answer is B. A jack-o'-lantern rotting in the sun is an example of a physical change because it involves changes in the appearance or state of the pumpkin without altering its fundamental composition. The process of rotting does not create new substances but rather causes the pumpkin to decompose, changing its texture, color, and other physical properties. This contrasts with a chemical change, where new substances are formed as a result of a chemical reaction.\n",
    "5379": "The answer is B. The phrase \"make some people nauseous\" indicates that the word is being used in its traditional sense as an adjective meaning causing nausea or feeling sick to one's stomach. Option A uses the word \"nauseous\" as a noun, referring to a state of feeling sick or unwell, which is not its traditional usage.",
    "5384": "The answer is B. Bumble bees are insects, which are invertebrates. The other options\u2014American crocodile, hummingbird, and lion\u2014are all vertebrates because they have backbones.\n",
    "5397": "The answer is B. The text uses a red herring fallacy by introducing an unrelated topic (the number of off-leash dogs) to divert attention from the actual issue being discussed, which is making the streets safe by addressing the dog problem. This makes it seem like the solution to the dog problem will also address the concern about criminals, which is not necessarily true. The focus should be on finding a solution to the dog problem without making unfounded assumptions about its connection to crime.\n",
    "5402": "The answer is C. Both are caused by heating.\n\nIn both scenarios, heat is applied to cause a change:\n- Water boiling on a stove involves heating water until it reaches its boiling point, where it changes from a liquid to a gas (steam).\n- Baking an apple pie involves heating the oven to a specific temperature, causing the ingredients inside the pie to cook and transform into a baked dish.\n\nThese processes involve heating as the primary cause of the changes observed.",
    "5406": "The answer is D. South Carolina.\n",
    "5411": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is shorter than in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be stronger in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.",

    "5449": "The answer is C. The sentence \"I will point her out to you\" uses the future tense because it includes the verb \"will,\" which indicates an action that is scheduled or expected to happen in the future.",
    "5463": "The answer is B. 20\u00b0F, as it is more appropriate to express temperatures in Fahrenheit during winter conditions where snow is present, rather than Celsius. 20\u00b0C is equivalent to approximately 68\u00b0F, which would be considered warm or mild weather, not cold and snowy.",
    "5464": "The answer is A. Boron trifluoride is a compound because it consists of two different elements, boron (B) and fluorine (F), bonded together in a specific ratio.",
    "5473": "The answer is B. Photosynthesis is a chemical change because it involves the conversion of carbon dioxide, water, and light energy into glucose and oxygen through a series of biochemical reactions.\n",
    "5487": "The answer is A. Paradox.\n\nIn this context, the statement \"Sally's Bistro used to be a great place to go for a delicious and carefully prepared dinner, but nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded\" presents a paradox because it simultaneously suggests that the restaurant was once excellent (\"used to be a great place\") and now it is so crowded that people avoid it (\"nobody goes there anymore\"). This contradiction creates an apparent inconsistency or paradoxical situation where both conditions cannot be true at the same time.",
    "5492": "The answer is D. Honolulu is the capital city of Hawaii.\n",
    "5495": "The answer is A. Tetraphosphorus is an elementary substance because it consists of only one type of atom, phosphorus, bonded together in a tetrahedral structure. Carbon tetraiodide and acetaldehyde are compounds, as they consist of different types of atoms bonded together.\n",
    "5501": "The answer is A. In the context of the Second Amendment, \"bear arms\" means to own weapons. This interpretation aligns with the historical and legal understanding of the amendment, which was designed to protect an individual's right to possess firearms for self-defense and other purposes. The other options (wearing sleeveless shirts, hunting bears, or joining the army) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the phrase \"bear arms\" as it pertains to the amendment.",
    "5508": "The answer is C. South Carolina.\n",
    "5509": "The answer is B. The temperature of both aquariums decreased during the 1.5-hour period, indicating that thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to the aquariums. This transfer of thermal energy can be attributed to the heat loss through the uncovered aquarium and the heat exchange with the surrounding environment in both aquariums.",
    "5517": "The answer is D. The European green toad is a reptile, while the other options are animals that are not reptiles: Hermann's tortoise is a turtle, bottlenose dolphin is a marine mammal, and zebra is a mammal.",
    "5518": "The answer is B. \"Keep\" does not rhyme with \"feed\" or \"seed.\"",
    "5520": "The answer is A. Lace monitor.\n\nLace monitors are known for their ability to use their neck to appear larger and more intimidating to potential predators. This behavior is called \"neck puffing\" or \"neck inflation,\" and it involves the snake puffing up its neck to make itself look bigger and more threatening. This can help deter predators and may also serve as a warning signal to other animals that the lace monitor is not to be trifled with. In contrast, bearded dragons are small lizards that do not have the same ability to puff up their necks in the same way as snakes.\n",
    "5523": "The answer is B.\n\nZoe's test involved giving extra nutrients to some bacteria and measuring the amount of insulin produced by these bacteria compared to bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients. This test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin as she had intended. Option A is incorrect because the test does not measure the growth rate of the bacteria, only the amount of insulin produced. Option C is also incorrect because the test only involved one type of bacteria, so it cannot determine whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin.\n",
    "5524": "The answer is B. \"A bullheaded employee\" has a more negative connotation because it implies stubbornness or a lack of willingness to change one's mind or approach, which can be seen as uncooperative or resistant to feedback or suggestions. On the other hand, \"a persistent employee\" suggests someone who is determined and keeps trying, which is generally viewed positively in most work environments.",
    "5531": "The answer is D. 18 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a hammer is typically a small tool used in construction or woodworking, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than meters or kilometers. Millimeters would be too small to accurately describe the length of a hammer, while meters or kilometers would be too large. Therefore, 18 centimeters is the most appropriate estimate for the length of a hammer.",
    "5532": "The answer is B. \n\nIn the food web shown, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the arrow points from the lichen to the collared lemming, indicating that the collared lemming consumes the lichen. Therefore, the collared lemming contains matter that was once part of the lichen.\n",

    "5544": "The answer is B. \n\nThe magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them. The closer the magnets are to each other, the stronger the magnetic force will be. In Pair 2, the distance between the magnets is smaller than in Pair 1, so the magnetic force in Pair 2 is stronger.\n",
    "5546": "The answer is A. \n\nSince both objects are identical in mass and material, the one with the lower temperature will have less thermal energy. Therefore, the 250-gram mug of cocoa at 90\u00b0F has less thermal energy compared to the 250-gram mug of cocoa at 95\u00b0F.",
    "5549": "The answer is A. Arctic fox.\n\nAn omnivore is an organism that eats both plants and animals. In the food web provided, the Arctic fox is shown to eat both the collared lemming (an animal) and the bilberry (a plant). Therefore, the Arctic fox is an omnivore.\n",
    "5550": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5551": "The answer is C. \"Cane\" does not rhyme with \"pine\" or \"dine.\"",
    "5555": "The answer is C. \n\nIn this context, the object with the least thermal energy would be the one with the lowest temperature. Since all three options refer to bowls of oatmeal, we can assume that they are made of the same material and size, so the only difference between them is their temperature. Therefore, the bowl of oatmeal at 101\u00b0F would have the least thermal energy compared to the other two options, as it has the lowest temperature among the three.",
    "5556": "The answer is A. The information that supports the conclusion that Susan inherited the trait of having straight hair is that both her biological parents have red hair, and she also has red hair. This suggests that the trait of having straight hair might be linked to the red hair trait, as it could be influenced by the same genetic factors or possibly even the same genes. However, it is important to note that this does not definitively prove that Susan inherited the trait from her parents, but it provides evidence that they share similar traits, which may indicate a genetic connection. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it only mentions Susan's mother's behavior, not her genetic makeup. Option C is also incorrect because it only mentions Susan's neighbor's hair, which is not relevant to Susan's genetic inheritance.\n",

    "5572": "The answer is B. Each aquarium lost thermal energy to the surroundings during this time.",
    "5575": "The answer is A. fuzzy fruit.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the tomato plant in question has the homozygous genotype \"ff\" for the fruit texture gene. Since the allele for fuzzy fruit (f) is recessive and the plant has two copies of this recessive allele, it will express the recessive phenotype, which is fuzzy fruit.",
    "5579": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.\n\nThis can be inferred by observing that all the magnets are made of the same material, which means they have the same magnetic properties. Additionally, the distance between the magnets in each pair is the same, as indicated by the 4-inch measurement. Since the material and distance are constant, the only variable affecting the magnetic force would be the size and shape of the magnets. However, since the problem states that the magnets in different pairs do not affect each other, we can conclude that the size and shape of the magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same, resulting in an equal magnetic force between the magnets in both pairs.\n",

    "5588": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"this sweatshirt\" could refer to either David's or Eric's sweatshirt, making it unclear who the sweatshirt belongs to. This creates a vague pronoun reference.\n\nOption B uses the pronoun \"his,\" which clearly refers to one of the two people mentioned in the sentence, thus avoiding any ambiguity.\n",
    "5590": "The answer is A. \n\nSince Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene, and the allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i), Kraken will express the dominant trait, which is a spotted tail. Therefore, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait is a spotted tail.",
    "5591": "The answer is B. A small candy bar would typically weigh around 30 grams, which is much lighter than 30 kilograms.",
    "5595": "The answer is A. Shelley's naturally pale skin is likely an inherited trait, as humans are born with their skin color, which is determined by genetic factors. While environmental factors such as sun exposure can affect skin tone, the initial skin color is typically established during fetal development and is influenced by genetics. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Shelley's naturally pale skin is an inherited trait.\n",

    "5915": "The answer is B. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, as the phrase \"as quiet as a jackhammer\" implies an extremely loud noise, contrary to the literal meaning of quiet.",
    "5916": "The answer is C. H2O2.\n",
    "5921": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four squares contain the genotype \"Bb\". Since the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b), any offspring with the genotype \"Bb\" will have a normal-sized body. Therefore, the probability that a rat produced by this cross will have a dwarf body is 0/4 or 0%.",
    "5923": "The answer is A. The statement \"The Phantom of the Opera became the longest running show in Broadway history on January 9, 2006\" is a fact because it provides specific, verifiable information about an event that occurred on a particular date. On the other hand, option B is an opinion or subjective statement as it expresses a personal judgment about the quality of the show without providing any factual evidence to support it.",
    "5927": "The answer is A. \n\nWater balloons typically hold around 500-600 milliliters of water, so option A (515 milliliters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option B (515 liters), which would be an extremely large amount of water for a single water balloon.",
    "5935": "The answer is B. The anthers are the part of the flower that produce pollen, so pollinators like bees or butterflies would pick up pollen from the anthers as they visit the flower to collect nectar.\n",
    "5941": "The answer is A. \n\nSince the plant has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit color gene, it means that both alleles are recessive (f). According to the given information, the allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f). Therefore, the presence of two recessive alleles (ff) results in the recessive phenotype, which is green fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait is green fruit.",
    "5945": "The answer is B. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the implication that it is quiet. The phrase \"as quiet as a jackhammer\" is used to emphasize how loud the snoring really is, making the statement ironic.",
    "5948": "The answer is A. 16\u00b0C. \n\nThis is because 16\u00b0C is the standard temperature setting for a freezer, while 16\u00b0F is closer to room temperature or slightly above it. Freezers typically operate between -18\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C, so 16\u00b0C is a more accurate representation of the temperature inside a freezer.",
    "5949": "The answer is A. The magnets will attract each other because opposite poles attract. In the first image, the north pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other magnet, causing them to attract. In the second image, the south pole of one magnet is facing the north pole of the other magnet, also causing them to attract.\n",
    "5954": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the title of the book is enclosed in quotation marks, which is the standard format for book titles. Option B uses asterisks (*) instead of quotation marks, which is not the correct formatting for book titles. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",
    "5962": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"his\" could refer to either Gary or Dave, making it unclear who got injured. This creates a vague pronoun reference because the reader cannot determine with certainty which person's arm was injured based solely on the sentence structure. Option A does not have this issue as \"he\" clearly refers to Gary in that context.\n",
    "5964": "The answer is A. Kansas is farthest north among the given options.\n",
    "5974": "The answer is B. 3 gallons. \n\nThis is because a typical bathroom sink can hold around 3 gallons of water, which is equivalent to approximately 11.4 liters or 3785.41 cubic centimeters. This is a reasonable estimate for the volume of a standard bathroom sink, as it would be large enough to accommodate a person washing their hands or face but not so large that it would be impractical to fill with water. The other options, such as 3 fluid ounces or 3 cups, are much smaller than the volume of a typical bathroom sink.",
    "5982": "The answer is A.\n",

    "6014": "The answer is B. When writing the title of a magazine, it should be enclosed in quotation marks to indicate that it is a specific title rather than a general term or phrase. Therefore, option B, \"The Open Road for Boys,\" is the correct way to write the title of a magazine. Option A uses asterisks instead of quotation marks, which is incorrect for this purpose.",
    "6017": "The answer is A. \n\nTodd can use his supplies to investigate whether cloth towels dry faster when hung in the laundry room compared to the backyard. This experiment would help him understand the effect of different environments on the drying process of cloth towels. He could set up one towel in the laundry room and another in the backyard, both under similar conditions, and observe which one dries faster. This setup allows him to control variables such as the type of cloth, the amount of water, and the initial state of the towels, while varying the location where they are hung to see the impact on drying time.\n",
    "6021": "The answer is A. The sentence uses a metaphor to compare Scooter, the dog, to a security guard. A metaphor is a figure of speech that makes an implicit comparison between two unlike things that actually have something in common. In this case, the sentence implies that Scooter acts as if he were a security guard, even though he is not one in reality.",
    "6024": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Isaac and his siblings share the same trait, which could indicate that they inherited it from their parents. However, it does not provide direct evidence of inheritance from either parent specifically. Option C also does not provide direct evidence of inheritance since it only mentions Isaac and his father, without any information about his siblings or other family members. Option A, while it might suggest that Isaac's mother has the trait, it doesn't directly support the conclusion that Isaac inherited it from her. Therefore, none of these options provide strong evidence to support the conclusion that Isaac inherited the trait from one specific parent. To determine if Isaac inherited the trait, we would need more specific information about the genetic makeup of both parents and how traits are passed down through generations.\n",
    "6030": "The answer is A. Talk would be found between the guide words \"tea\" and \"touch\" in a dictionary because it comes alphabetically after \"tea\" and before \"touch.\"",
    "6033": "The answer is A. Ovis aries.\n\nExplanation: The bighorn sheep's scientific name is Ovis canadensis. The genus of an organism is the first part of its scientific name. Therefore, the genus of the bighorn sheep is Ovis. The organism with the same genus as the bighorn sheep would be another animal whose scientific name begins with \"Ovis\". Option A, Ovis aries, is the only option that matches this criterion.\n",
    "6048": "The answer is B. It has only a few types of trees.\n\nExplanation: The image shows a dense forest with many tall trees, indicating that it has a large number of tree species. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is correct because the forest appears to be diverse, with various types of trees coexisting in the same area.",

This skill could have been acquired through various means such as learning it in an after-school program, taking a class, practicing independently, or even being taught by someone else. Option A provides a plausible scenario where Jessica learned the skill, supporting the conclusion that she has the ability to knit sweaters. Option B describes her current activity but does not provide any information about how she acquired the skill.",
    "6061": "The answer is A. False dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist. Dave is making a binary choice between voting for the Conservative Party or the Labour Party, but there could be other political parties or independent candidates that he might consider as well. This limits his options and does not account for the possibility of other choices.\n",
    "6063": "The answer is A. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms to create a paradoxical effect. In this case, \"open secret\" is an oxymoron because \"open\" implies something that is known by many people, while \"secret\" suggests that it should be kept hidden. The phrase highlights the contradiction between these two concepts, making it a clear example of an oxymoron.\n",
    "6064": "The answer is A.\n",
    "6067": "The answer is A. According to Newton's third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the Sun is pulling on Earth, then by Newton's third law, Earth must also be pulling back on the Sun with an equal and opposite force. This is because the Sun's gravitational pull on Earth causes Earth to orbit around the Sun, and vice versa.",
    "6071": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use a comma after the salutation. Therefore, option B, \"Dear Dr. McKee,\" is the correct format. Option A, \"dear Dr. McKee,\" omits the comma, which is incorrect in standard English usage.",

    "6080": "The answer is A. Malayan colugo.\n\nThe Malayan colugo is a small, nocturnal primate that is native to Southeast Asia. It is known for its unique ability to glide through the air using a membrane of skin that stretches between its limbs. This adaptation allows the colugo to move quickly and efficiently through the forest canopy, making it an excellent arboreal predator. The colugo's limbs are also adapted for climbing and gripping, allowing it to move easily through the trees and branches of its habitat. While the Sumatran orangutan is also an arboreal primate, it does not have the same gliding adaptations as the Malayan colugo.\n",
    "6081": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"The barber and his brother opened their shop in Harlem more than thirty years ago,\" there is only one independent clause (\"The barber and his brother opened their shop\") with no dependent clauses or phrases.

    "6119": "The answer is C. \n\nThis option suggests that both Jayden's biological parents have wavy hair, which implies that there is a genetic predisposition for wavy hair in their family. This supports the conclusion that Jayden inherited the wavy hair trait from his parents. \n\nOption A does not provide any information about genetics or inheritance, as it only mentions that Jayden uses a headband to keep his wavy hair out of his face. Option B also does not provide evidence of genetic inheritance, as it only states that Jayden's mother has long hair and Jayden has long hair himself. Therefore, neither of these options support the conclusion that Jayden inherited the wavy hair trait.\n",

    "6130": "The answer is A. The statement \"Vicky's father has brown eyes. He passed this trait down to Vicky\" supports the conclusion that Vicky inherited the brown eye trait because it indicates that there is a genetic link between Vicky and her father, suggesting that the trait was passed down through their family lineage. This is consistent with the concept of inheritance in genetics where traits can be passed from parents to offspring through genes. Option B does not provide any information about the inheritance of the trait but rather describes a correlation between Vicky's hair and eye color, which is not directly related to the inheritance of the eye color trait.",
    "6135": "The answer is A.\n",
    "6147": "The answer is C. 0:4\n\nExplanation: All four squares in the Punnett square show the genotype rr, meaning all the offspring will have the recessive allele for not having thorns. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns is 0:4.\n",

    "6181": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option provides specific evidence of how Gabby acquired the ability to build a fire, indicating that she learned it at summer camp. This directly supports the conclusion that Gabby has the trait of knowing how to build a fire because it shows the method by which she obtained this knowledge. Option A, while related to the trait, does not provide information about how Gabby acquired the skill; it only states that she can use the skill to cook food, which is an outcome rather than the acquisition process.\n",
    "6182": "The answer is A. The information supporting the conclusion that Kiara acquired the scar on her right elbow is that it was caused by an accident where she cut her arm while falling off her bicycle.

This type of appeal is known as ethos, which focuses on the credibility and authority of the source or the product itself.\n",
    "6370": "The answer is B.\n\nIn this scenario, if Stacy decides to see the meerkats, spending more time walking to them would be considered a cost because it involves an additional effort or resource that Stacy must allocate in order to achieve her goal of seeing the meerkats. This extra time spent walking could potentially detract from her overall experience at the zoo, as she might miss out on other attractions or activities that are closer to where she initially planned to go. On the other hand, enjoying the meerkats more than she would have enjoyed seeing the monkeys is a benefit, not a cost, since it aligns with her initial goal of seeing lots of animals.\n",
    "6373": "The answer is A. Nathan's biological parents have wavy hair. This indicates that Nathan likely inherited the wavy hair trait from one or both of his parents, as traits are passed down through genetic material from parents to offspring. The other options do not provide evidence of inheritance but rather describe physical characteristics or actions related to Nathan's hair.\n",
    "6374": "The answer is B. The sentence \"Mrs. Hatfield manages the busy office\" uses the present tense because it describes an ongoing action or state that is currently happening. The verb \"manages\" indicates an action that is in progress now, rather than in the past or future.",
    "6380": "The answer is B. As Candice rode down the hill, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased because the sled was moving closer to the ground, thus reducing its height above the ground.

Since \"casket\" starts with the letter 'c', it would be placed on a page where the guide words include 'c' or 'k'. Therefore, it would not be found between \"clatter\" and \"comic\".",
    "6390": "The answer is A. Press release A is more formal because it uses complete sentences, proper capitalization, and punctuation, while also providing specific details such as the date and the exact location of the event. Press release B, on the other hand, is less formal due to its use of abbreviations (\"Nov.\") and a more casual tone.",
    "6399": "The answer is A. Straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against.\n\nIn this case, Ms. Stafford's suggestion is being mischaracterized as suggesting that algebra is a useless subject, which is not necessarily her position.

The other options, poison dart frog, fire salamander, and mandarinfish, are not mammals as they do not have fur or feed their young milk.\n",
    "6418": "The answer is B. \n\nSentence B uses more formal language by referring to \"several important proposals\" instead of simply stating \"some things,\" and it also uses the phrase \"to discuss\" rather than just \"to bring up.\" This makes it sound more professional and appropriate for a formal setting like a city council meeting.\n",
    "6419": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (S-N), which means they will attract each other. However, in Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force would be the same in both pairs. However, since the direction of the force is different, we cannot say that one pair has a stronger or weaker force than the other. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 because it involves repulsion, while Pair 2 involves attraction.\n",

Appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good.\n\nIn the given text, the argument is made that since ancient ancestors ran without shoes, running shoes cannot be better for one's feet. This is an example of appealing to nature, as it assumes that because something is natural, it must be inherently good or superior. The argument does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that running shoes are inferior to running barefoot; instead, it relies on the idea that what was done by our ancestors must be the best way to do things today. This is a common logical fallacy known as the \"appeal to nature,\" where the conclusion is based on the assumption that something is good simply because it is natural.",

    "8139": "The answer is B. The allusion to \"Your nose is growing\" is a reference to the biblical story of Jonah, where God tells Jonah to go to Nineveh and preach repentance. When Jonah refuses, God sends a great wind that causes a shipwreck, and Jonah is swallowed by a large fish. After three days, Jonah is spit out onto dry land, and he goes to Nineveh as God instructed. However, when Jonah arrives, he finds that the people of Nineveh have already repented and turned away from their evil ways. This makes Jonah angry, and he prays that God will not save the people of Nineveh. God then tells Jonah that his prayer has been answered, but that he should still go to Nineveh and preach repentance. When Jonah finally goes to Nineveh, he preaches to the people, and they repent and turn away from their evil ways. This story is often used as an example of how people can change their behavior and turn away from their sins if they are willing to repent.\n\nIn the given text, the mother is using the allusion to suggest that Elise is lying about loading the dishwasher before watching Dancing with the Stars. The mother is implying that Elise is being dishonest, just like Jonah was in the Bible story. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Elise was lying.\n",

    "8381": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"factoid\" is used in its traditional sense as a made-up or false piece of information presented as if it were true. This aligns with the original definition of a factoid, which was coined by Norman Mailer in 1973 to describe a piece of trivia or misinformation that is often repeated as if it were factual. In contrast, option B uses \"factoid\" to refer to a true piece of information, which is not consistent with the traditional usage of the term.\n",
    "8389": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this context, thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy its particles possess, resulting in greater thermal energy.

    "8390": "The answer is B. \n\nMost scars are caused by accidents during a person's life, which means they are typically acquired rather than inherited. Inherited traits are passed down through genes from parents to offspring, while acquired traits result from environmental factors or experiences that occur during an individual's lifetime. Since scars are usually formed due to injuries or accidents, they fall under the category of acquired traits.",
    "8393": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nIn both cases, there is no change in the chemical composition of the substances involved. Butter melting on a hot day is a physical change where the state of matter changes from solid to liquid due to an increase in temperature. Similarly, sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is also a physical change where particles of sediment are separated from the liquid due to gravity or other forces acting upon them. Neither of these processes involves any chemical reactions that alter the fundamental nature of the substances involved. Therefore, both changes can be classified as physical changes.",

    "8702": "The answer is B. Both are caused by heating.\n\nExplanation: Both burning a candle and burning a marshmallow over a campfire involve the application of heat to cause a chemical reaction that results in the combustion of the materials. The heat causes the wax or other components of the candle and the marshmallow to break down into simpler substances, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. This process is an example of a chemical change because it involves the rearrangement of atoms to form new molecules. Therefore, both activities share the common factor of being caused by heating.",

    "9124": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn the given diagram, both samples have the same average particle speed (1,400 m/s). However, the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A (46 u vs. 28 u).\n\nSince the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the difference in temperature between the two samples depends on the difference in their masses. According to the equation for kinetic energy (KE = 0.5 * m * v^2), where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity, the sample with the greater mass will have a higher kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, Sample B, with the greater mass of its particles, has the higher average kinetic energy and thus the higher temperature.\n",

This option represents a cost because it involves additional effort and time that Jeffrey must expend in order to see the zebras instead of the gibbons, which are closer. While Jeffrey may enjoy seeing the zebras more than the gibbons, the extra time spent walking to them is a tangible cost associated with his decision. Option A, on the other hand, describes a benefit or positive outcome, as Jeffrey will enjoy seeing the zebras more than he would have enjoyed seeing the gibbons.",
    "9193": "The answer is B. \n\nWhen Lola decides to make cream of mushroom soup instead of minestrone soup, spending more time making the cream of mushroom soup than she would have spent making the minestrone soup is considered a cost because it means she is using her time in a way that could have been used to prepare another meal or activity.

About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.\nOne of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.\nBeetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food",

    "11848": "The answer is A. Thresher sharks have fins, not limbs, they hatch from eggs with no shells, and they can use their tail to hit and stun their prey. Additionally, thresher sharks live in salt water, which is consistent with the characteristics of fish. On the other hand, Amazon milk frogs have moist skin, live in South American rain forests, and hatch from eggs with no shells but do not have fins or live in salt water, so they do not meet all the criteria for being classified as fish.",
    "11851": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to give the tomatoes a human-like quality by saying they \"boasted\" of their bountiful harvest. This makes the sentence more vivid and engaging, as if the tomatoes were proud of their produce. \n\nSo, the complete sentence would be: \"At the farmer's market, bright red tomatoes boasted of a bountiful harvest.\"\n",
    "11863": "The answer is B. \n\nText message B is more formal because it uses proper capitalization, punctuation, and includes the title \"Ms.\" before the name, which adds a level of formality to the message. Text message A is less formal as it uses an exclamation point and lacks proper punctuation and title usage.",
    "11873": "The answer is B. Black rockfish.\n\nIn the food web, the black rockfish is shown to be preyed upon by the orca. This means that the matter contained within the black rockfish will eventually move to the orca as it consumes the black rockfish. However, the question asks for the organism that contains matter that eventually moves to the bat star. The bat star is shown to be preyed upon by the sea otter, so the matter contained within the bat star will eventually move to the sea otter. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Black rockfish.\n",

    "11962": "The answer is B. The word \"anchor\" would not be found between the guide words \"account\" and \"apart\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific entries by indicating the first and last words on a page. If an entry starts with a word that comes after the second guide word, it means the entry is on a different page. In this case, \"anchor\" would be on a page where the guide words are something like \"anchor\" and \"apart,\" or even later in the dictionary.",

    "11982": "The answer is A. Europe.\n",
    "12005": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence refers to Achilles' heel, which is a term originating from Greek mythology. In the Iliad, Achilles' mother Thetis dipped him in the River Styx, making him invulnerable everywhere except his heel where she held him. This heel became his weakness, leading to his downfall during the Trojan War. Thus, the phrase \"Achilles' heel\" is used metaphorically to describe a person's vulnerable point or weakness.",
    "12006": "The answer is C. transparent.\n\nAll four objects - window, glass, icicle, and ceramic tea cup - are transparent to varying degrees. This means that light can pass through them without being blocked or scattered significantly. While the window may have some degree of opacity due to its structure, it still allows light to pass through it. The glass and icicle are completely transparent, allowing light to pass through them unobstructed. The ceramic tea cup may have some level of transparency as well, but it is not as transparent as the other three objects. Therefore, the best answer is C. transparent.\n",

    "12022": "The answer is A. European robin.\n\nEuropean robins have a conical beak that is well-suited for catching insects, as it allows them to easily pick up and consume small prey items like insects, worms, and spiders. This type of beak is called a \"insectivorous\" beak, and it is common among many bird species that feed primarily on insects. In contrast, the rosy-faced lovebird has a shorter, more curved beak that is better suited for eating seeds and fruits, so its beak is not adapted to catch insects.\n",
    "12025": "The answer is C. \n\nChristina can use the available supplies to investigate whether small rocks or large rocks skip more times when thrown across the river. She can throw both small and large flat rocks into the river and observe how many times each type skips before sinking. This will help her determine if there is a correlation between rock size and the number of skips. The other options involve different variables such as the type of body of water (river vs. pond) and the shape of the rocks (flat vs. round), which would require additional supplies or a different set of experiments to address those questions effectively.",
    "12027": "The answer is B. The cup of black tea with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. When an object has more thermal energy, it means that its particles are moving faster and have higher kinetic energy, resulting in a higher temperature. Conversely, when an object has less thermal energy, its particles move slower and have lower kinetic energy, leading to a lower temperature. Therefore, the cup of black tea with less thermal energy will be cooler than the one with more thermal energy.",

    "12030": "The answer is A. Having horns.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that in genetics, when an organism has one dominant allele and one recessive allele (heterozygous), it will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele. In this case, the allele for having horns (h) is recessive, while the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant. Since Zelda has the genotype Hh, she will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which is having horns.",

    "12076": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by observing that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "12092": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is important to use proper capitalization and punctuation. Option A uses \"Dear\" with a capital \"D,\" followed by the recipient's name in title case (Uncle Brian). Option B omits the capitalization of \"Dear\" and uses lowercase letters for the rest of the greeting, which is incorrect according to standard writing conventions. Therefore, option A is the correct choice for a formal letter greeting.",

    "12114": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Max's mother has blue eyes. She passed this trait down to Max\" provides evidence that Max inherited the blue eye trait from his mother, as traits are typically passed down through genes from parents to offspring. This is a common example of genetic inheritance where an individual inherits specific traits from their parents.",
    "12118": "The answer is B. Snowy owls have sharp, curved beaks and live in cold places. They have feathers on their feet to protect them from the cold. Mother owls keep their eggs warm by standing on their shells. This description matches all the bird traits mentioned: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and lay eggs with shells. \n\nOption A describes black howler monkeys, which do not have feathers, wings, a beak, or lay eggs with shells, so they do not fit the criteria for being classified as birds.\n",

    "12164": "The answer is A. If Trevor decides to join the Photography Club, spending more time in the Photography Club than he would have spent in the Theater Club would be considered a cost because it means he is giving up time that could have been spent on other activities or pursuits. This trade-off between time spent in one club versus another is often referred to as a cost in decision-making scenarios.",
    "12168": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1.

This helps to distinguish the title from the surrounding text and makes it clear that the enclosed text is meant to be read as the title of something specific. Therefore, option B, \"A Good Day for an Outing,\" is the correct way to show the title of a movie. Option A, with asterisks around the title, is not a standard format for movie titles and would typically be used in other contexts, such as in a list or a catalog.",
    "12197": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample B. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the particles in Sample A will have more kinetic energy due to their larger mass.

Therefore, the short-tailed weasel contains matter that was once part of the bear sedge.\n",
    "12302": "The answer is B. Circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself. This is because the statement \"Senator Robinson isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents\u2014she wouldn't lie to people she cares about\" is essentially stating that Senator Robinson is telling the truth because she wouldn't lie to those she cares about, which is a circular argument as it relies on the initial claim to support itself.",

    "12462": "The answer is B. The word \"tickled\" would not be found between the guide words \"throw\" and \"true\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific entries by indicating the first and last words on a page. If \"tickled\" were to appear in the dictionary, it would be placed after \"true\" since it comes alphabetically after \"true.\"",
    "12467": "The answer is A. \n\nSentence A is a statement that can be verified as true or false based on factual information. Sentence B, on the other hand, expresses an opinion and cannot be proven true or false universally, as it depends on personal beliefs and values.",
    "12479": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the size and shape of the magnets can affect their magnetic force. In Pair 1, the magnets are larger and have more surface area to interact with each other, resulting in a stronger magnetic force. In Pair 2, the magnets are smaller and have less surface area to interact with each other, resulting in a weaker magnetic force. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n",
    "12480": "The answer is C. Topeka.\n",
    "12482": "The answer is B. The scar on Sam's right knee is an acquired trait because it is a result of an injury that occurred in Sam's life, rather than being determined by genetic factors passed down from his parents. Inherited traits, on the other hand, are characteristics that are passed down from parents to offspring through their genes.",
    "12484": "The answer is B. \n\nScarlett's knowledge about history can be inferred to be due to her learning process, which involves reading or studying historical materials. This indicates an active engagement with the subject matter, suggesting that Scarlett has developed her understanding through educational activities such as reading books, articles, or other resources related to history. Option A, while it could be a part of Scarlett's interests, does not directly support the conclusion that she acquired the trait of knowing a lot about history. It only implies her interest in a specific area within history, but not necessarily her overall knowledge across the field.",
    "12485": "The answer is B. Appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good.\n\nIn the given text, the author argues that since pasteurization is a human invention, it is better to drink milk raw because it is \"pure\" and \"unchanged.\" This is an example of the appeal to nature fallacy, where the speaker assumes that something is inherently better or more desirable simply because it is natural or unaltered by human intervention. The argument does not provide any evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that drinking raw milk is better for one's health compared to pasteurized milk.",

Option A contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\" (\"Albert stacked a crate of oranges on top of the crate of lemons\" and \"checked both crates off his order sheet\"), thus making it a compound sentence.",
    "12518": "The answer is D. Frankfort.\n",
    "12519": "The answer is A.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are Bb. Since the allele for a greenish-brown body (B) is dominant over the allele for a blue body (b), all of the offspring will have a greenish-brown body. Therefore, the probability that a rainbow trout produced by this cross will have a greenish-brown body is 4/4 or 100%.\n",
    "12520": "The answer is A. Lynx lynx.\n\nExplanation: The bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus. In biological classification, organisms that belong to the same genus share the same first part of their scientific names.

    "12579": "The answer is C. With the given supplies, Sandra can investigate whether apple slices dipped in orange juice turn brown more slowly than plain apple slices. This is because she has two apples, one of which she can use to make the orange juice, and she can compare the browning rate between the plain apple slices and those dipped in the orange juice. The other apple can be used as a control to ensure that the browning is due to the dip rather than the apple itself. The other options involve different fruits (banana and pear), which are not present in her supplies, so she cannot conduct experiments related to those.\n",
    "12583": "The answer is C. Straight spines. \n\nBased on the image, it is evident that the fossil of Miocidaris has straight spines extending from its body. These spines are clearly visible in the fossil, indicating that this was one of the traits that Miocidaris possessed during its time in the ocean. The other options, such as a mostly orange body or a mushroom-shaped body, cannot be observed on the fossil since they are not present in the image.\n",
    "12591": "The answer is B.

    "12644": "The answer is B. If Dan decides to make beef barley soup, spending more time making it than he would have spent making split pea soup would be considered a cost because it means he is using his time and effort in a way that could have been used to prepare another meal or activity. This additional time spent on one option compared to the other is a direct cost associated with his decision to make beef barley soup instead of split pea soup.",
    "12647": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Cutting an apple involves breaking it into smaller pieces without changing its fundamental composition or creating new substances. This is a physical change because no new chemical compounds are formed. Similarly, shaking up salad dressing involves mixing ingredients together but does not create any new chemical compounds; it merely changes the state of the mixture. Therefore, both actions are classified as physical changes.",

    "12752": "The answer is A.\n\nMarvin's test showed that the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C. This is because he set up an indoor test chamber at 50\u00b0C and left the weather station inside for 24 hours. After checking the readings, he determined whether the weather station displayed accurate measurements under these conditions. This test helped Marvin ensure that the weather station would function properly in unusually warm weather, as the highest recorded temperature in the town was 40\u00b0C.\n",
    "12757": "The answer is B. Bb.\n\nThis means that Nico's genotype for the body hair gene is heterozygous, with one allele for a hairy body (B) and one allele for a hairless body (b). Since the allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b), Nico will express the phenotype of having a hairy body.",
    "12760": "The answer is A. Since the donkeys are moving the carts at the same speed, it means that they are exerting the same amount of force on each cart. Therefore, the cart that is pulling a heavier load will require more force to be moved at the same speed as the other cart. In this case, the cart holding 82 pounds is heavier than the cart holding 59 pounds, so it would require a larger force to be pulled at the same speed by the donkeys.",

She divided these plants into two groups: one group was soaked in water once a week, while the other group was sprayed with water every day in addition to being soaked. The group that was only soaked in water once a week served as the control group because it did not receive any additional treatment beyond the regular watering schedule. This allowed Ellen to compare the growth of the plants in the control group to the growth of the plants in the experimental group, which received extra daily watering. By doing so, Ellen could determine whether the additional daily watering had a positive effect on the growth of the air plants.\n",

    "12957": "The answer is A. \n\nA sentence fragment is a group of words that expresses an incomplete thought or does not contain a subject and a predicate. Option A, \"A cheese sandwich with lettuce and tomato,\" is a sentence fragment because it lacks a subject and a predicate. It describes the contents of a sandwich but does not express a complete thought. On the other hand, option B, \"The girls climb on the bars at the playground,\" is a complete sentence because it contains both a subject (\"the girls\") and a predicate (\"climb on the bars at the playground\").\n",
    "12959": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 32 u and the average particle speed is 1,100 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 16 u and the average particle speed is 910 m/s.\n\nWe can use the formula for kinetic energy, KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity of the particle. Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can compare the kinetic energies by comparing the products of the masses and velocities squared.\n\nFor Sample A:\nKE_A = 0.5 * 32 u * (1,100 m/s)^2\n\nFor Sample B:\nKE_B = 0.5 * 16 u * (910 m/s)^2\n\nSince the mass of each particle in Sample A is greater than the mass of each particle in Sample B, and the average particle speed in Sample A is also greater than the average particle speed in Sample B, the product of the mass and velocity squared for Sample A will be greater than the product for Sample B. Therefore, Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.\n\nSo, the answer is A: Sample A has the higher temperature.\n",
    "12972": "The answer is B. \n\nIn thermodynamics, thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles in the object possess, resulting in more thermal energy.

This is characteristic of chemical changes, as opposed to physical changes where the composition of matter does not change but its form or state does.",
    "13898": "The answer is C. a new plant.\n\nDouglas fir seeds are capable of growing into new plants if they find suitable conditions to germinate and grow. They require a specific environment, such as moist soil and adequate sunlight, to develop into mature trees. Once the seeds germinate, they produce roots that anchor the young plant in place and absorb water and nutrients from the soil. As the plant grows, it develops leaves, branches, and eventually a trunk, allowing it to reach maturity and reproduce by producing its own seeds. Therefore, the correct answer is C. a new plant.\n",

    "15664": "The answer is A. The text uses verbal irony, where the speaker says something that is opposite to their actual meaning. In this case, the speaker is saying that Danny's room is tidy, but it is actually described as being \"as tidy as an overgrown garden,\" which implies that the room is messy or disorganized. This creates a contrast between the literal meaning of the statement and its intended meaning, making it ironic.\n",
    "15677": "The answer is B. The idiom \"Speak of the devil!\" is often used to express that someone is being mentioned right after they appear or enter the scene. In this case, Becky says it because she was talking about Dirk before he walked into the room. This suggests that Becky had just been speaking about Dirk.\n",
    "15688": "The answer is A. Lissotriton helveticus.\n\nExplanation: The smooth newt's scientific name is Lissotriton vulgaris. In biological classification, organisms that belong to the same genus share the same first part of their scientific names. Therefore, the organism with the scientific name starting with \"Lissotriton\" would be in the same genus as the smooth newt. Option A, Lissotriton helveticus, matches this criterion, while options B and C do not start with \"Lissotriton,\" indicating they are not in the same genus as the smooth newt.\n",
    "15695": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"moan\" would not be found between the guide words \"mask\" and \"meek\" because it does not start with an M or any letter that comes after M in the alphabet.

    "15798": "The answer is B. The cookie with less thermal energy has a lower temperature. \n\nThermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. When an object has more thermal energy, it means that its particles are moving faster and have higher kinetic energy, resulting in a higher temperature. Conversely, an object with less thermal energy has slower-moving particles and lower kinetic energy, leading to a lower temperature. Therefore, the cookie with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature compared to the other cookie.",
    "15801": "The answer is C. Guilt by association is a logical fallacy where a person or idea is discredited based on their association with something else that is considered undesirable or wrong. In this case, the argument is that because no one is born writing plays like Shakespeare did, he must have had formal schooling. This is an attempt to discredit the idea that Shakespeare could have learned to write plays without formal schooling by associating it with the notion that only those who have been formally educated can write plays.",
    "15814": "The answer is A. Radish would be found between \"right\" and \"ruby\" in a dictionary because it comes alphabetically after \"right\" and before \"ruby\".",
    "15816": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "15823": "The answer is A. The poem \"The sky is low, the clouds are mean,\" by Emily Dickinson, uses alliteration with the repetition of the 'l' sound in words like \"low,\" \"clouds,\" \"mean,\" and \"through.\" This creates a rhythmic effect and emphasizes the somber mood of the poem. \n\nIn contrast, the poem \"Look back with longing eyes and know that I will follow,\" by Sara Teasdale, does not use alliteration. While there are some consonant sounds present, they are not repeated enough to create an alliterative effect throughout the poem.\n",
    "15830": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use a comma after the salutation. Therefore, option B, \"Dear Aunt Sarah,\" is the correct format. Option A, \"dear Aunt Sarah,\" omits the comma, which is incorrect in standard English usage.\n",

    "15878": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nThis is because Rick's naturally straight hair is likely due to his genetic makeup, which is passed down from his parents. Since the trait is present in him, it suggests that he inherited it from one or both of his parents who also have naturally straight hair. If the trait were acquired, it would mean that Rick developed the straight hair through environmental factors such as styling or chemical treatments, rather than inheriting it genetically.",
    "15884": "The answer is B. Joel's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes. This suggests that Joel inherited the trait of having hazel eyes from his father, as the trait is likely to be passed down through genetic inheritance. The other options do not provide evidence of genetic inheritance, as they either involve unrelated individuals or do not directly relate to the trait being discussed.\n",
    "15892": "The answer is B. 325 milliliters. \n\nThis is because a standard can of soda pop typically holds around 325 milliliters of liquid.

It has a light brown or tan color that helps it camouflage itself among the sand dunes and rocks. This adaptation allows the Namaqua chameleon to avoid predators and hunt more effectively by blending in with its surroundings. On the other hand, the polar bear is adapted to the cold Arctic environment and is not typically found in sandy deserts.\n",
    "15973": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and water and melting wax both involve changes in the state or form of matter without altering its fundamental composition. Mixing sand and water results in a mixture where the sand particles are dispersed throughout the water, but they remain distinct entities. Similarly, melting wax involves changing the wax from a solid to a liquid state, but the wax molecules themselves do not undergo any chemical transformation; they simply change their arrangement due to an increase in temperature. Therefore, both processes are classified as physical changes because no new substances are created, and the original properties of the substances involved are preserved.",
    "15974": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Ben's parents had the trait of straight hair and passed it down genetically to Ben, indicating that Ben inherited the trait from them.

This means that Buddhism began approximately 1,100 years before Islam, making option A the correct statement. Option B is incorrect because Buddhism began about 1,300 years after Judaism, not 300 years.\n",
    "16036": "The answer is B. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. The magnetic force decreases as the distance between the magnets increases, so the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker than the force between the magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "16044": "The answer is A.\n\nNembrotha megalocera is an animal, and animals cannot make their own food. They must consume other organisms or organic matter to obtain the nutrients they need to survive. This process is known as heterotrophy, where animals obtain their energy by consuming other organisms or organic matter. In contrast, plants and some other organisms can produce their own food through photosynthesis, which is a process that uses sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create glucose, a type of sugar that serves as a source of energy for the organism. Therefore, Nembrotha megalocera cells cannot make their own food.\n",
    "16054": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"Brad asked for a rematch after Daniel beat him in tennis,\" the pronoun \"him\" could refer to either Brad or Daniel, making it unclear who Brad is asking for a rematch with. This creates a vague pronoun reference.\n\nOption B, \"After Daniel beat Brad in tennis, he asked for a rematch,\" is clearer because the pronoun \"he\" refers to Daniel, as it is the subject of the sentence and the one who beat Brad in tennis. Therefore, there is no ambiguity here.\n",

    "17277": "The answer is A. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Edward. This means that the forces acting on Edward are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net force of zero. Since the net force is zero, Edward remains stationary or moves at a constant velocity, as per Newton's first law of motion.",
    "17288": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to complete the sentence with an action that gives the phone a human-like quality. \"Hiding\" implies that the phone is in a place where it is difficult to find, which can be seen as giving the phone a human-like characteristic of being secretive or elusive. On the other hand, \"ringing\" would imply that the phone is actively doing something, which doesn't fit the context of the sentence as well as \"hiding\" does.\n",
    "17290": "The answer is A. \n\nSentence A uses formal language with the phrase \"Attention customers\" and capitalizes the first word of the sentence, making it more appropriate for a formal setting such as a business announcement or notice to customers.

In contrast, the European robin does not have any protective features that would help it defend itself against such predators.\n",
    "17312": "The answer is B. This is an interrogative sentence because it is asking a question. The sentence contains a question mark and is seeking information, making it different from imperative (which gives a command or instruction) or declarative (which makes a statement).",
    "17322": "The answer is A. It has soil that is poor in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees.\n\nThe Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem, which means it has a mix of deciduous trees that lose their leaves seasonally. These forests typically have rich soils that are good for growing a variety of plant species. However, the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest is known to be one of the oldest and most pristine temperate forests in Europe, and it is located in a region with relatively low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils. This means that the soil in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest is likely to be poor in nutrients, and the trees in the forest may be limited in number and diversity compared to other temperate forests. Therefore, option A is the better description of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest ecosystem.\n",
    "17325": "The answer is B. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite words to create an effect.

    "18931": "The answer is B. The poem in option B uses end rhyme, as evidenced by the rhyming words such as \"look\" and \"broken.\" Option A does not exhibit any end rhyme.",
    "18932": "The answer is A. The term \"Luddite\" refers to people who oppose technological change, particularly in manufacturing processes. This term originates from the Luddites, a group of workers in England during the early 19th century who destroyed machinery they believed was threatening their jobs. Thus, the allusion in the sentence comes from British history.",
    "18938": "The answer is B. Sauce burning on a stove is a chemical change because it involves a chemical reaction where the sauce undergoes a transformation due to heat, changing its properties and composition. This results in new substances being formed, which is characteristic of a chemical change.",
    "18940": "The answer is C. Concord.\n",
    "18947": "The answer is C. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: Cooking an egg involves a chemical change where the proteins in the egg white denature due to heat, causing them to coagulate and form a solid structure. An antacid tablet reacting with water also represents a chemical change; it typically involves the tablet dissolving in water and releasing its active ingredient, which reacts chemically with the acid in the stomach to neutralize it. Neither process can be described as purely physical because they involve molecular-level interactions that alter the substances involved.",
    "18951": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond. This means that the forces acting on Desmond are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net force of zero. Since the diving board is pushing up on Desmond with a force of 400N and Earth's gravity is pulling down on Desmond with a force of 400N, these forces cancel each other out, leaving no net force on Desmond. Therefore, Desmond is in equilibrium and will remain stationary unless an external force acts upon him.",
    "18952": "The answer is B. The statement \"Paul was not born knowing how to identify different fish. He had to learn this skill\" supports the conclusion that Paul acquired the trait of being good at identifying fish. This implies that the ability to identify fish is something that Paul developed through experience or learning rather than being an innate characteristic he was born with. Option A does not provide evidence of Paul acquiring the trait; it only states that he has pet fish, which could be related but doesn't directly indicate how he learned to identify fish.",
    "18961": "The answer is D. An ostrich is a bird.\n",
    "18962": "The answer is A. In option A, \"At the grocery store, Estelle hastily grabbed fruits and vegetables at random, filling her shopping cart with a hodgepodge of food,\" the word \"random\" is used in its traditional sense, meaning without any particular order or plan. This contrasts with option B where \"random\" is used more loosely to describe an unplanned trip, but it doesn't carry the same connotation as in option A.",
    "18972": "The answer is B. The sentence \"Akiko teaches Whitney about customs in Japan\" uses the present tense because it describes an ongoing action or a general truth that is currently happening.",
    "18974": "The answer is D. 157 years.\n\nTo find the time that passed between these two events, we need to subtract the year of the Constitutional Convention from the year the Civil War began:\n\n1861 - 1787 = 74 years\n\nHowever, since the Civil War began in 1861, we need to add one more year to account for the fact that the Civil War started in 1861, not in 1860. Therefore, the total time that passed between the Constitutional Convention and the start of the Civil War is 74 + 1 = 75 years.\n\nSince none of the given options match 75 years, it seems there might be an error in the provided options or the timeline. However, based on the information given, the closest option would be (D) 157 years, as it is the only option that is close to the calculated value of 75 years.\n",
    "18982": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and water and a rock heating up in a campfire both involve changes that can be reversed without altering the fundamental composition of the substances involved. Mixing sand and water results in a mixture where the sand particles are suspended in the water, but they can be separated back into their original forms. Similarly, heating a rock in a campfire causes it to change temperature, but it does not alter its chemical composition or structure. Therefore, both scenarios represent physical changes rather than chemical ones, as no new substances are created or old substances are destroyed during the process.",
    "18986": "The answer is B. The metaphor suggests that despite the negative situation of losing his job, there was a positive aspect or opportunity for Connor to pursue a new career, which could be seen as a light in the midst of the darkness caused by the job loss. This implies that even in challenging times, there can still be opportunities for growth and change.",
    "18989": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Francesca.\n\nTo explain further, in physics, a net force is the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object. If the forces acting on an object are balanced, meaning they cancel each other out, then the net force on that object is zero. In this case, the force of gravity pulling Francesca down is 600N, and the force of the seat pushing her up is 1,200N. Since these forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. Therefore, the forces on Francesca are balanced, and there is no net force acting on her.",

    "19053": "The answer is B. Violet Sabrewing. \n\nViolet Sabrewings are known for their long, slender beaks that are well-adapted for extracting nectar from deep flowers. This adaptation allows them to access nectar that other birds cannot reach, giving them a competitive advantage in their environment. The broad-tailed hummingbird, as shown in the figure, also has a long, slender beak that is adapted for getting nectar out of long flowers, similar to the Violet Sabrewing. However, the Violet Sabrewing is a different species with its own unique adaptations, making it the correct answer to the question.\n",
    "19056": "The answer is C. neither; their concentrations are the same.\n\nExplanation: Both solutions have the same volume of solvent (20 mL), but they also contain an equal number of pink particles (4). Since the number of solute particles is the same in both solutions, their concentrations are the same.\n",

    "19081": "The answer is B. the West Indies.\n\nIn the triangular trade, the West Indies were an important location where enslaved people were traded to work on plantations. Merchants would bring manufactured goods from Europe to Africa, exchange them for enslaved people, then transport the enslaved people to the West Indies to work on plantations. The enslaved people would produce goods like sugar, tobacco, and coffee, which would be shipped back to Europe to be sold. This trade route was known as the triangular trade because it formed a triangle between Europe, Africa, and the West Indies.\n",
    "19087": "The answer is A. Shawna's scar on her right hand is most likely an acquired trait because it was caused by an accident during her life, rather than being passed down through her genes from her parents.",

    "19103": "The answer is A. Penny's phenotype for the body size trait is a dwarf body.\n",
    "19104": "The answer is A. The word \"weak\" would not be found between the guide words \"warn\" and \"whip\" because it does not fall within the alphabetical range that those words represent. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the beginning and end of the alphabetical order for the words that follow them. Since \"weak\" comes after \"warn\" and before \"whip,\" it would be found on a page between these two words if it were present in the dictionary. However, since it is not listed as an option, we can conclude that it would not be found on a page with the given guide words.",
    "19108": "The answer is C. Columbia.\n",
    "19110": "The answer is A. \n\nThe Tibetan Plateau is a high-altitude region with harsh weather conditions, including long, cold winters. The climate is too cold and dry to support large trees, so the vegetation is mostly small plants such as grasses, shrubs, and mosses. This type of ecosystem is known as a tundra, characterized by its low temperatures and short growing season. Therefore, option A better describes the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem.\n",
    "19113": "The answer is B. The object with the lower temperature will have less thermal energy. Since the 350-gram cup of black tea at 110\u00b0F has a lower temperature than the one at 195\u00b0F, it will have less thermal energy.",
    "19119": "The answer is B. The sentence uses a simile because it compares the heat in the attic to that of an oven using the word \"like.\" A simile explicitly states the comparison between two things by using words such as \"like\" or \"as,\" while a metaphor directly states the comparison without using these words.",
    "19129": "The answer is C. A banana at a temperature of 92\u00b0F has the most thermal energy because it is the warmest among the three options provided. Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy its particles possess, resulting in greater thermal energy. Therefore, the banana with the highest temperature will have the most thermal energy.",

It has a long, curved beak that it uses to catch fish and other small animals. Like the great blue heron, the saddle-billed stork has a long neck that it can use to reach into water and grab fish without moving its body. This allows it to stay hidden and avoid scaring the fish away.",
    "19173": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to use a word that gives the painting human-like qualities, such as attracting attention. \"Attracted\" fits well with this concept because it implies that the painting has a quality that draws people towards it, much like how a person might attract others' attention. \n\nSo, the complete sentence would be: \"No one could ignore the hideous painting, which attracted the attention of every visitor.\"\n",
    "19174": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all the offspring have the genotype ee, which means they will have red eyes because the allele for red eyes (e) is recessive. Therefore, there are no offspring with brown eyes in this cross. The expected ratio of offspring with red eyes to offspring with brown eyes is 4:0.\n",
    "19181": "The answer is A. Ardea alba.\n\nExplanation: The great blue heron belongs to the genus Ardea, so we need to find another organism that also belongs to the same genus.

    "19295": "The answer is B. If Maria decides to go as a ghost, she will need to spend some time and money to get the costume, since she already has a superhero costume that she could potentially use instead. This would be a cost because it involves an expenditure of resources, such as time and money, in order to achieve her desired outcome of going as a ghost to the costume party.",
    "19299": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Bending a paper clip involves changing its shape without altering its chemical composition or structure. This is a physical change because no new substance is created, and the properties of the paper clip remain the same except for its shape.\n- Cracking open a peanut also involves a physical change. When you crack a peanut, you are breaking it into smaller pieces but not changing its fundamental chemical makeup. The peanut remains a peanut; it just has been divided into smaller parts.\n\nNeither of these actions results in a chemical reaction that produces a new substance, so they both qualify as physical changes.",

    "19575": "The answer is A.\n\nExplanation: The text states that all organisms inherit certain traits from their parents, and that information about these inherited traits is found in genes. This means that all organisms have genes, as they are responsible for passing on traits to offspring. Therefore, option A is correct. Option B is incorrect because eye color is an example of a trait, not a gene. Genes are the units of inheritance that determine specific traits, such as eye color, but the trait itself is the result of the interaction between multiple genes and environmental factors.\n",

    "19785": "The answer is B. The allusion to Pinocchio's nose growing suggests that Patty might be lying or exaggerating her story about loading the dishwasher before watching Dancing with the Stars. This is because in the classic fairy tale, Pinocchio's nose grows longer whenever he tells a lie. Therefore, her mother's response implies that Patty may not be telling the truth about her actions.",
    "19803": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles are equally likely. Since the allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m), any goat with at least one M allele will have myotonia congenita. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita is 3:1.\n",

(C) Hinduism began about 500 years before Judaism.\nAnswer: The answer is B.\n\nContext: Read the text about okapis.\nWhen you first see an okapi, you might think it's related to a horse or a zebra. Its body and neck are horse-like, and its legs have black-and-white stripes like a zebra does. But the okapi is not related to a horse or a zebra; its closest relative is actually the giraffe. In fact, okapis are sometimes called forest giraffes, since they live mainly in the rain forests of central Africa.\nAn okapi's relationship to a giraffe is most noticeable in its face. Like giraffes, okapis have long, thin faces topped with large, upward-pointing ears. Male okapis also have little furry horns like giraffes' horns. Additionally, both giraffes and okapis have long, dark tongues, which can grab and strip leaves from trees. And just like giraffes, okapis are plant eaters, feeding on leaves, buds, twigs, and fruit.\nIn many ways, though, okapis are quite different from their giraffe cousins. An okapi's neck is much shorter than a giraffe's. This is useful, because a long neck would make it difficult to move through thick vegetation.",
