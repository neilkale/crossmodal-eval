    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, as the statement \"his snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer\" implies that it is much louder than a jackhammer, which is known for being extremely loud.",
    "7": "The answer is B. Armored catfish have mouths that are adapted for bottom feeding, similar to sturgeons. Their mouths are located on the underside of their heads and point downward, allowing them to easily access food at the bottom of bodies of water. Discus, on the other hand, are freshwater fish that primarily feed on floating vegetation and small invertebrates, so their mouths are not adapted for bottom feeding.",
    "8": "The answer is A. The given phrase \"During the construction of Mount Rushmore, approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock from the mountain to create the monument\" is not a complete sentence because it lacks a subject and a predicate. It is missing the necessary components to express a complete thought or idea. Therefore, it is considered a sentence fragment.",
    "13": "The answer is C. Wendy's test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. By comparing the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria that received extra nutrients to the amount produced by the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, Wendy can determine if the additional nutrients had a positive effect on insulin production. This will allow her to assess whether she successfully increased the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria by 20%. Options A and B are not directly related to the specific goal of Wendy's experiment, which is to increase insulin production by 20% through the addition of extra nutrients.",

    "71": "The answer is B. 40 liters. \n\nThis is because the volume of a car's gas tank is typically measured in liters, and 40 liters is a reasonable estimate for the capacity of a standard car gas tank. 40 milliliters would be far too small to serve as a typical gas tank capacity.",

    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" This makes it a compound sentence because each clause can stand alone as a complete thought.

    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction where the acid in the vinegar reacts with the copper oxide on the surface of the penny, converting it back to copper, thus removing the tarnish. This process changes the composition of the substance, making it a chemical change.",
    "165": "The answer is B.",
    "169": "The answer is A. The word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because \"import\" starts with the letter \"i,\" but it is positioned alphabetically after \"industry.\" Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the range of letters that the word begins with. Since \"import\" does not start with an \"i\" that comes before \"industry,\" it would be placed further down the dictionary than the given guide words.",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion \"Midas touch\" suggests that Tyler is successful at all that he does, implying that he has an innate ability to succeed without needing special experience or training.",

    "227": "The answer is B. Alec learned how to knit in an after school program. This option directly indicates that Alec acquired the ability to knit sweaters through learning, which supports the conclusion that he has this trait. Option A only describes what materials Alec uses to knit, but it does not provide any information about how he acquired the skill to knit sweaters.",
    "231": "The answer is B. Noah was upset about staying home. Verbal irony occurs when someone says something that means the opposite of what they actually mean, often to express sarcasm or humor. In this case, Noah's statement suggests that he would prefer to be with his friends at the water park rather than studying for a test, indicating that he is upset about being forced to stay home.",
    "240": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Cooking a pancake involves the chemical reaction that occurs when the batter is heated, causing the proteins to denature and the starches to gelatinize, resulting in the formation of a pancake.\n- Rust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical reaction where iron reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide (rust). This process is an example of a chemical change.\n\nTherefore, both cooking a pancake and rust forming on a bicycle frame are chemical changes.",
    "241": "The answer is B. Peregrine falcons have all the bird traits listed above: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and they hatch from eggs with shells. Burmese pythons, on the other hand, do not have feathers, wings, or a beak, and they lay eggs without shells.",

    "256": "The answer is A. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where a negative attribute (getting speeding tickets) of one person (Mariana's brother) is used to discredit another person (Mariana). This is an attempt to associate Mariana negatively based on her brother's actions, even though there is no direct evidence linking Mariana to those speeding tickets.",

    "5463": "The answer is (A) 20\u00b0C. \n\nThis is because 20\u00b0C is a more accurate representation of a cold, snowy day compared to 20\u00b0F. On a cold, snowy day, temperatures are typically much lower than 20\u00b0C, often in the single digits or even below freezing. The Fahrenheit scale is less commonly used in scientific contexts and can be misleading without conversion to Celsius or Kelvin. Therefore, option (A) 20\u00b0C is the better estimate for the temperature of the air on a cold, snowy day.",

By measuring the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria that received extra nutrients compared to those that did not, Zoe can determine if the additional nutrients had a positive effect on insulin production. This will help her assess whether the bacteria were able to produce 20% more insulin as intended. Option A is incorrect because the test does not measure the growth rate of the bacteria, only their insulin production. Option C is also incorrect because the test only compares the insulin production of bacteria that received extra nutrients versus those that did not, so it cannot determine if different types of bacteria would require different nutrients for insulin production.",
    "5524": "The answer is B. \"A bullheaded employee\" has a more negative connotation because it implies stubbornness or a refusal to change one's mind, which can be seen as uncooperative or difficult to manage in a professional setting.

    "8139": "The answer is B. The allusion to \"Your nose is growing\" is a reference to the biblical story of Jonah, where God tells Jonah to go to Nineveh and preach against its sins. When Jonah refuses, God sends a great wind that causes a large fish to swallow him. After three days, the fish spits Jonah out onto dry land. Jonah then goes to Nineveh as God instructed, but the people of Nineveh repent and God decides not to destroy the city. When Jonah is angry because the people of Nineveh repented, God tells him, \"Your nose is growing.\" This phrase is used to describe someone who is lying or telling a fib, as it implies that the person's nose will grow longer if they continue to lie.

    "15751": "The answer is C. Neither; the samples have the same temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of the gases, we need to compare their average kinetic energies. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is the average speed of the particle.\n\nFor Sample A:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_A \\)) = 26 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_A \\)) = 1,600 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_B \\)) = 46 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_B \\)) = 1,600 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 46 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same for both samples, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A because the mass of each particle in Sample B is greater.\n\nHowever, since the average kinetic energy is also related to the temperature of the gas, and the temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy per particle, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature. Thus, Sample B has the higher temperature.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) sample B.",
