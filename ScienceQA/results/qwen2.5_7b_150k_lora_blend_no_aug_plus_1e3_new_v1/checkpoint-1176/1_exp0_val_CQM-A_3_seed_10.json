  "outputs": {
    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\" Jackhammers are known for their extremely loud noise, so saying that Mr. Herrera's snoring is as quiet as one implies that his snoring is actually quite loud.",
    "7": "The answer is B. Armored catfish.\n\nThe image shows a sturgeon with its mouth adapted for bottom feeding, as it is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Since the question asks for an animal whose mouth is also adapted for bottom feeding, we can infer that the animal should have a similar mouth structure to the sturgeon. Among the given options, the armored catfish is known to be a bottom feeder and has a mouth adapted for this purpose, making option B the correct answer.\n",
    "8": "The answer is A.\n\nThe given statement is not a sentence fragment because it contains a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"to create\"), making it a complete thought or independent clause. It describes an action that took place during the construction of Mount Rushmore, which is a full sentence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered a sentence fragment.\n",
    "13": "The answer is C. Whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin.\n",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title format for a play, as it follows standard capitalization rules for titles, with each word capitalized except for articles, conjunctions, and prepositions unless they are the first or last word in the title.",
    "16": "The answer is B.\n",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns.\n",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon.\n\nExplanation: The New Zealand falcon is a bird of prey that is native to New Zealand. It is known for its sharp talons and hooked beak, both of which are adaptations for capturing and killing prey. These features allow the New Zealand falcon to catch and hold onto small birds, insects, and other animals with ease. While the bald eagle in the image is also an animal that has feet adapted for grabbing prey, the New Zealand falcon is the correct answer as it is specifically mentioned in the context provided.\n",
    "36": "The answer is A.\n",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.\n",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to give the raindrops a human-like action. \"Kissing\" the fans' cheeks is a more expressive and personified way to describe the rain falling on their faces compared to simply \"landing on\" them. It adds a sense of warmth and affection to the scene, as if the rain is gently caressing the fans.",
    "52": "The answer is C. Earthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.\n",
    "55": "The answer is A.\n",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture.\n",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" contradicts the observation that the pug seems to sleep all day. This creates a humorous effect by using irony to highlight the contrast between the pug's appearance and its actual behavior.\n",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence refers to the biblical story of the prodigal son, who left his father\u2019s house and squandered his inheritance, only to return home with nothing and be welcomed back by his father. This story is found in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 15, verses 11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 20 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 75 to 230 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as it is closer to the actual capacity of a car's gas tank.\n",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho is the state that is farthest north among the given options.\n",
    "74": "The answer is B. Austen learned how to build a fire at summer camp. This option provides a specific context and event where Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, supporting the conclusion that she has this trait. Option A only states that Austen can cook food over a fire, but it does not provide any information about how she acquired this skill or if it is related to building a fire specifically.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft.\n\nAll three objects can be described as soft. Soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a soft gelatin dessert, and an apron is typically made of soft material like cotton or polyester.\n",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.\n",
    "81": "The answer is B.\n",
    "82": "The answer is B. Sturgeon. \n\nSturgeons are bottom feeders that have mouths adapted to filter food from the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Their mouths are located on the underside of their heads and point downward, similar to the armored catfish. This adaptation allows them to easily access and consume small invertebrates and other food sources found at the bottom of water bodies. On the other hand, clown triggerfish are not bottom feeders and their mouths are not adapted for filtering food from the bottom of the ocean or other aquatic environments.\n",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 41\u00b0C is equivalent to approximately 106\u00b0F, which would be considered very hot rather than cold. On a cold, rainy day, the temperature is more likely to be in the range of 41\u00b0F or lower.",
    "101": "The answer is B.\n",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing towards it, indicating that it is being consumed by other organisms in the ecosystem. Therefore, the barren-ground caribou is a consumer in this food web.\n",
    "113": "The answer is B. To determine the speed of each ship, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor Ship A:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_A = \\frac{555 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 55.5 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nFor Ship B:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_B = \\frac{95 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 9.5 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nFor Ship C:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_C = \\frac{460 \\text{ km}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 46 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Ship A: 55.5 km/h\n- Ship B: 9.5 km/h\n- Ship C: 46 km/h\n\nShip B had the lowest speed at 9.5 km/h. Therefore, the ship that was moving at the lowest speed is Ship B.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur\" because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), resulting in an expression of short fur.\n",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence, while a dependent clause cannot. Therefore, this sentence is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses that are connected by a coordinating conjunction (in this case, \"so\").\n",
    "124": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: All of the offspring in the Punnett square have the genotype ee, which means they will all have black eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0.\n",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting both bags at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a greater force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option indicates that Rosa's father has brown eyes, suggesting that he passed the trait of brown eyes to Rosa through genetic inheritance. This supports the conclusion that Rosa inherited the brown eye trait from her father.\n",
    "148": "The answer is A.\n",
    "150": "The answer is B.\n",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, implying that Richard might also be involved in similar illegal activities. This is an attempt to discredit him based on a negative association rather than on any evidence related to Richard himself.\n",
    "160": "The answer is B.\n",
    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction between the acid in the vinegar and the metal in the penny, which results in the removal of the tarnish. This process changes the composition of the tarnish and the penny itself, making it a chemical change.\n",
    "165": "The answer is B.\n",
    "169": "The answer is A. The word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the first and last words on a page. If a word is not between these guide words, it means the word is either before or after them alphabetically. Since \"import\" comes after \"industry,\" it would be found on a different page.\n",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion \"Midas touch\" refers to someone who is exceptionally skilled or fortunate in their endeavors, often implying that they can turn anything into gold. In this context, it suggests that Tyler is successful at everything he does, as he has been able to launch a thriving business and establish a respected charity without any special experience or training. This implies that Tyler possesses an innate ability or talent that allows him to excel in various aspects of life.\n",
    "178": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and another idea that provides additional information or explanation (according to many scholars).\n\nOption B, \"Although presidential elections take place in early November, a president's term does not begin until the end of January,\" is also a complex sentence. It has an independent clause (\"a president's term does not begin until the end of January\") and a dependent clause (\"although presidential elections take place in early November\").\n\nBoth options contain complex sentences, but since the question asks for only one correct answer, both A and B would be considered correct based on the given context. However, if we need to choose just one, either A or B could be selected as they both meet the criteria for being complex sentences.\n",
    "206": "The answer is B.\n",
    "213": "The answer is C. \"Made\" does not rhyme with \"slide\" or \"ride.\"\n",
    "221": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use the full name with the title or honorific, followed by a comma. Therefore, \"Dear Grandpa Tim\" is the correct format. Using just \"grandpa Tim\" would be less formal and might be considered informal in a professional or formal context.\n",
    "227": "The answer is B. Alec learned how to knit in an after school program. This option provides evidence of how Alec acquired the ability to knit sweaters, indicating that he likely learned it through formal instruction or practice rather than simply knowing how to do it without any prior knowledge or training. Option A only describes what materials Alec uses to knit, but does not provide any information about how he acquired the skill.",
    "231": "The answer is B. Noah was upset about staying home.\n",
    "240": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: Cooking a pancake involves the chemical reaction between the ingredients, such as flour, eggs, and milk, to form a new substance that is different from its original components. Similarly, rust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical reaction where iron reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide, commonly known as rust. Both processes involve the formation of new substances through chemical reactions rather than just physical changes.\n",

It is known for its distinctive appearance, with a bright red body and a green head. Like the scarlet macaw, the Alexandrine parakeet has a strong, curved beak that is adapted to crack open large, hard nuts. This adaptation allows it to access the nutritious seeds and nuts that make up a significant part of its diet. The blue rock pigeon, on the other hand, is a small bird that is native to Europe and Asia. Its beak is not as strong or curved as that of the Alexandrine parakeet, and it is not adapted to crack open large, hard nuts. Instead, it has a more pointed beak that is better suited for pecking at seeds and insects.\n",

Option B uses \"can\" in a different context, where it refers to permission or availability rather than capability.",
    "376": "The answer is A. queen conch.\n\nThe queen conch has a hard outer shell that it can pull its soft parts into when attacked by a predator with sharp teeth. This adaptation helps protect the queen conch from being eaten by predators. The collared dove does not have a hard outer shell, so it would not be as well adapted for protection against a predator with sharp teeth.\n",
    "384": "The answer is D. Cheyenne.\n",
    "393": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, the sentence \"The stars () as we gazed up in wonder\" can be completed with \"winked\" to give the stars human-like qualities, making them appear to interact with the people observing them. This creates a more engaging and imaginative scene, as if the stars are playfully acknowledging the viewers' amazement. Option A, \"glowed,\" would also work well but does not convey the same playful interaction as \"winked.\"\n",

    "472": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"disinterested\" is used in its traditional sense as meaning impartial or unbiased. Patrick is expressing that he does not have an interest in reading restaurant reviews because he prefers to form his own opinions based on personal experience rather than relying on someone else's perspective.\n\nIn option B, \"disinterested\" is used in its modern sense as meaning lacking interest or enthusiasm. This usage is different from the traditional sense, where \"disinterested\" would mean impartial or unbiased. Here, Patrick is saying that the restaurant reviews are not impartial because they may be influenced by the restaurants paying to remove negative reviews, but he still finds them useful for finding new places to eat.\n",
    "475": "The answer is B. A short tail can be observed in the drawing of the Ichthyornis skeleton.",
    "481": "The answer is B. Flood.\n\nIn the given sentence, \"Water builds up in a city after heavy rain,\" it indicates that there is an excessive amount of water accumulating in the city due to rainfall. This situation aligns more closely with the concept of a flood, where water levels rise above normal levels, often causing damage or disruption. A drought, on the other hand, refers to a prolonged period of dry weather conditions, which is the opposite of what is described in the sentence. Therefore, option B, \"flood,\" is the correct choice that better matches the sentence.\n",

    "661": "The answer is B. The forces acting on Kylie are unbalanced because the force of gravity (600N) pulling her downward is less than the force of the seat pushing her upward (1,200N). Since there is a difference in these forces, there is a net force acting on Kylie, causing her to accelerate upward as she goes through the loop. This acceleration is due to the unbalanced forces, making option B the correct choice.",
    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "664": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will attract each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N and S-S), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs, just with opposite directions.\n",

This indicates that the scar is a new trait that Pablo developed due to the accident, rather than inheriting it from his mother or having it since birth.",
    "821": "The answer is A. The poem \"Down, down, down!\" by Alice Ruth Moore uses repetition with the phrase \"Down, down, down!\" repeated three times, creating a sense of movement and rhythm. This repetition helps to emphasize the downward motion of the mermaid as she descends into the depths of the sea. On the other hand, the poem \"The Poor Old Year Died Hard\" by Matthew Arnold does not use any repetition.\n",
    "825": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Paul, its height above the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) remains constant if no external forces other than gravity act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon does not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy must be balanced by an increase in its kinetic energy. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "829": "The answer is A. There is white ash on the ground. \n\nThis can be inferred from the image as there is a large area with white ash covering the ground, indicating that it was affected by a wildfire. The presence of white ash suggests that the fire burned intensely and consumed the vegetation in the area, leaving behind the ash as a result. The other option, \"Some of the trees have green leaves,\" is not supported by the image since most of the trees appear to be dead or burnt due to the wildfire.\n",
    "837": "The answer is A. The passage describes the weather because it refers to the specific conditions observed in Manuel's location during a particular time period (last week). Weather involves short-term atmospheric conditions, while climate refers to long-term patterns of weather in a given area. Since the passage mentions cumulus clouds every day for an extended period, it is describing the weather rather than the climate.\n",
    "838": "The answer is B. The circulatory system helps remove carbon dioxide waste from the body by transporting it to the lungs where it can be exhaled. It also delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells throughout the body and removes cellular waste products. While the digestive system breaks down food into small pieces, the circulatory system is responsible for transporting nutrients and oxygen to the cells and removing waste products.",
    "839": "The answer is B.\n",
    "846": "The answer is A. No, you would not find the word \"wild\" on a dictionary page with the given guide words \"well\" and \"word\". Guide words are used to indicate the first and last words on a page in a dictionary, and they help readers locate specific words quickly. In this case, since \"wild\" comes between \"well\" and \"word\", it would be found on a different page than the one with these guide words.",
    "847": "The answer is A. The trait of having a scar on Reggie's left hand is an acquired trait because it is caused by an external event, such as an injury or surgery, rather than being determined by genetic factors. Inherited traits, on the other hand, are passed down from parents to offspring through their genes. Since scars are typically the result of physical trauma or medical procedures, they are not considered to be inherited traits.",
    "855": "The answer is B. The word \"mumble\" would not be found between the guide words \"medicine\" and \"mid\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific entries by indicating the first and last words on a page. If a word is not between these guide words, it means the word is either before or after them alphabetically. Since \"mumble\" comes after \"mid,\" it would be found on a page with guide words like \"midnight\" or later.",
    "859": "The answer is B. The description of the gray tree frog matches all three of the amphibian traits mentioned: spending part of their lives in water and part on land, having moist skin, and making eggs with no shells.

    "919": "The answer is A. Flamboyant cuttlefish.\n\nFlamboyant cuttlefish have a unique ability to change their color and pattern to blend into their surroundings or to communicate with other cuttlefish. They also have specialized skin cells called chromatophores that can expand or contract to change the color of their skin. This allows them to display warning signals to potential predators, such as bright colors or patterns that indicate they are toxic or dangerous. In contrast, impalas rely on their speed and agility to escape predators rather than using warning signals through their skin.\n",
    "920": "The answer is A. During this time, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each pizza. As the pizzas were placed in a car, they were exposed to the surrounding air temperature, which is typically lower than the initial temperature of the pizzas.

    "1005": "The answer is A. Circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself.\n\nIn this case, the statement \"President Ballard is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people\" is an example of circular reasoning. It assumes the conclusion as one of its premises, which is not logically sound. To properly evaluate whether President Ballard is an effective communicator, one would need to consider other factors such as his ability to convey ideas clearly, his impact on audiences, and the results of his communication efforts. The statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning beyond the claim itself, making it an instance of circular reasoning.\n",

    "1046": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nRust forming on a bicycle frame involves iron reacting with oxygen and water to form iron oxide, which is a new substance different from the original iron. This is a chemical change.\n\nGrilling a hamburger involves cooking the meat through heat, which causes the proteins in the meat to break down and form new compounds. This is also a chemical change.\n\nTherefore, both rusting and grilling are examples of chemical changes.\n",
    "1051": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard involves separating iron from other materials without altering their chemical composition. This is a physical change because no new substances are created or destroyed; it simply rearranges existing materials.\n\nSewing an apron also represents a physical change. While sewing involves manipulating fabric and thread to create a garment, the materials themselves do not undergo any chemical reactions that would alter their fundamental properties. The process of sewing is purely mechanical, involving the joining of materials through stitching, which does not involve any chemical transformation.\n\nTherefore, both activities\u2014removing iron with a magnet and sewing an apron\u2014are examples of physical changes where no new substances are formed or altered chemically.\n",

    "1071": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (S-N), while in Pair 2, they are facing the same poles towards each other (N-S). Since opposite poles attract and like poles repel, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be attractive, while the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be repulsive. However, since all the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic properties should be similar, so the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs.\n",

    "1181": "The answer is A. Euphemism.\n\nIn this context, \"downsizing\" is being used as an euphemism for reducing the workforce or cutting jobs. It is a more polite way of saying that the company is laying off employees or reducing its staff size. The use of euphemisms can help soften the impact of negative news or make it easier to discuss sensitive topics without causing offense or distress.\n",
    "1182": "The answer is A. Chital.\n\nChital, also known as spotted deer or axis deer, is a species of deer native to the Indian subcontinent. They are known for their long necks, which allow them to reach high branches and browse on leaves and twigs in trees. This adaptation helps them access food sources that are out of reach for other herbivores, providing them with a competitive advantage in their environment. In contrast, bison, which are large bovids native to North America, do not have long necks and primarily graze on grasses and other low-lying vegetation.\n",

The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.\n\nThis can be inferred by considering that all the magnets are made of the same material, meaning they have the same magnetic properties. Since the distance between the magnets in each pair is also the same, the strength of the magnetic force will be determined by the shape and size of the magnets themselves. In this case, since the shapes and sizes of the magnets in both pairs are identical, the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs.\n",
    "1198": "The answer is B. 60 cups. \n\nBlenders typically have a capacity of around 4 to 8 cups, so 60 cups would be an unusually large size for a blender. 60 fluid ounces is also a reasonable estimate, but it is less common than cups as a unit of measurement for blenders. Therefore, option B is the best estimate among the given options.",
    "1201": "The answer is A. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Milk going sour involves a chemical reaction where lactic acid is produced as bacteria break down lactose in milk, leading to the souring process.\n- Roasting a marshmallow over a campfire involves a chemical change where the marshmallow undergoes pyrolysis, breaking down into simpler compounds due to heat, resulting in the characteristic sweet taste and texture of roasted marshmallows.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions that transform the substances involved without changing their fundamental nature, making them chemical changes rather than physical changes or changes caused by cooling or heating alone.",

    "2031": "The answer is B.\n\nExplanation: Bryant's test involved putting a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel and observing its behavior at 200 km per hour. This test would allow him to determine how steady the parachute was at this speed, as he was specifically interested in the movement of the parachute and its potential impact on the spacecraft. Option A is incorrect because the test did not involve a speed of 400 km per hour, only 200 km per hour. Option C is also incorrect because the test did not involve any damage to the spacecraft; it only observed the movement of the parachute.\n",
    "2036": "The answer is B.\n\nIn the context provided, \"factoid\" traditionally refers to a piece of information that is presented as a fact but is actually false or misleading. Option B describes Tracy's dislike of certain sci-fi movies because they present \"factoids\" that misrepresent her field, which aligns with the traditional usage of the term. Option A uses \"factoid\" in a more general sense, referring to any piece of information, without implying that it is necessarily false or misleading.\n",
    "2041": "The answer is A. If Henry decides to plant the hickory tree, the cost would be that the hickory tree will use up more space than the carnations would have used up. This means there might be less space available for other activities or plants in his backyard, which could limit his ability to enjoy the backyard as much as he would like. On the other hand, option B describes a benefit rather than a cost, as it indicates that Henry will get to see the hickory tree and find it more beautiful than the carnations.",
    "2056": "The answer is A. The colder soccer ball has less thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object possesses. A colder object has fewer kinetic energy particles, resulting in lower thermal energy compared to a hotter object with more kinetic energy particles.\n",

    "2410": "The answer is A. 22 seconds. \n\nThis is because jumping jacks are a form of exercise that can be done relatively quickly, typically taking around 22 seconds to complete one set of ten jumps. It is important to note that the time may vary depending on factors such as the individual's fitness level, speed, and technique. However, in general, it would be more realistic to expect to complete ten jumping jacks in approximately 22 seconds rather than 22 hours.\n",
    "2415": "The answer is B. Thistles are a type of flowering plant covered in prickly spines. Thistle plant cells contain chloroplasts, and their flowers contain nectar that attracts birds and butterflies. This indicates that thistles are capable of photosynthesis, as they possess chloroplasts within their cells, which are essential for the process of photosynthesis. On the other hand, red sea urchins are marine animals that obtain minerals from the water to form their spines, but they do not have chloroplasts or the ability to perform photosynthesis. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, thistles are the photosynthetic organism.\n",
    "2427": "The answer is A. Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it contains more green balls (representing solute particles) in relation to its solvent volume compared to Solution B.\n",
    "2430": "The answer is B. Since the golf ball is sitting still on the grass, it means that its position relative to the ground is not changing. Therefore, its velocity is zero, and it can be said to have a constant velocity of zero. This implies that the golf ball is not accelerating, as acceleration would require a change in velocity over time.",
    "2433": "The answer is A. With the given supplies, Britney can investigate whether small rocks or large rocks skip more times when thrown across the river. This is because she has access to both small and large flat rocks, allowing her to compare their skipping abilities. However, she does not have any round rocks, so she cannot investigate option C.

    "2560": "The answer is A. 50 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a standard tennis racket measures approximately 27 inches or 68.58 centimeters in length. Therefore, option A provides a more accurate estimate compared to option B, which is an extremely large distance that would be impractical for a tennis racket.",
    "2565": "The answer is B. Kelp.\n\nIn the food web, the arrow pointing from kelp to sea cucumber indicates that the sea cucumber consumes kelp. Therefore, the matter contained within the kelp will eventually move to the sea cucumber as it is consumed.",
    "2587": "The answer is D. Saint Paul.\n",
    "2589": "The answer is B. The thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each salmon as they were exposed to the heat from the charcoal in the grill. As the temperature of the salmon increased, it indicates that the thermal energy was being transferred from the surroundings to the salmon.",
    "2592": "The answer is B.\n",
    "2594": "The answer is A. The term \"chimerical\" refers to something that is imaginary or fantastical, often associated with mythical creatures. In Greek mythology, a chimera was a fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. Therefore, the allusion in the sentence comes from Greek mythology.\n",
    "2596": "The answer is A. The word \"travesty\" in option A is used in its traditional sense to mean a distorted or exaggerated representation of something, as seen in the context of Walter's poorly researched essay about the Space Race. Option B uses the word \"travesty\" in a different sense, referring to something that is considered ridiculous or absurd, rather than a distorted or exaggerated representation.",

    "2611": "The answer is D. Delaware.\n",
    "2620": "The answer is B. The sentence \"Janelle blows big bubbles, Damon pops them\" is a run-on sentence because it combines two independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions. It should be split into two separate sentences: \"Janelle blows big bubbles. Damon pops them.\" This makes each clause stand alone as a complete thought, adhering to proper sentence structure.\n",
    "2622": "The answer is D. The beaver is shown to eat the silver maple tree, and the arrow points from the silver maple tree to the parasol fungus, indicating that the matter from the silver maple tree moves to the parasol fungus.",
    "2632": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option A, \"Sacramento is the capital of California\" is a complete sentence with a subject (\"Sacramento\") and a predicate (\"is the capital of California\"). The second part, \"the state government meets there,\" is a complete sentence as well, but it is not connected to the first part by a conjunction or other means, making it a separate sentence fragment. \n\nOption B, \"All the goats, cows, and horses on the farm,\" is missing a verb and a subject, so it is not a complete sentence. It is a list of animals without any action or statement being made about them, thus making it a sentence fragment.\n",
    "2635": "The answer is B. A lamp is considered a good because it is a physical object that can be owned and used to provide light. It is not a service, which refers to an action or activity performed by one party for another, such as providing a haircut or delivering food.",

    "2646": "The answer is B.\n",
    "2652": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"he\" is a vague pronoun reference because it is unclear who \"he\" refers to. It could be either Jake or his best friend. To avoid ambiguity, it would be better to specify the person being referred to, such as \"Jake\" or \"his best friend.\"\n",
    "2653": "The answer is C. This is an interrogative sentence because it asks for a reason to consider purchasing a hybrid vehicle, seeking information or an opinion rather than making a statement or giving a command.\n",
    "2655": "The answer is C. Vermont is the state that is farthest north among the given options.\n",
    "2657": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample B. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in mass between the particles in each sample will affect their average kinetic energy. The average kinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Therefore, since the particles in Sample A have a greater mass, they will have a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature compared to the particles in Sample B.\n",
    "2659": "The answer is B. The magnets will attract each other because opposite poles attract. In the image, one magnet has its north pole facing down and the south pole facing up, while the other magnet has its south pole facing down and the north pole facing up. Since the north pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other magnet, they will attract each other.\n",

    "2666": "The answer is B. Classical mythology.\n\nIn this sentence, the allusion refers to Hercules, a legendary hero from Greek mythology known for his immense strength and numerous feats. The term \"Herculean\" is used here to describe an effort that is extremely difficult or strenuous, similar to how Hercules was often depicted as performing incredible tasks. Thus, the source of the allusion is classical mythology.",
    "2668": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this context, both options describe a 6-kilogram block of steel, but they differ in temperature. Since thermal energy is directly related to an object's temperature, the object with the lower temperature will have less thermal energy. Therefore, option B, the 6-kilogram block of steel at 65\u00b0F, has less thermal energy compared to the one at 110\u00b0F in option A.",
    "2669": "The answer is C.\n",
    "2670": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, the pronoun \"her\" is vague because it could refer to either Mrs. Trevino or her friend.

Mitochondria primarily function as the powerhouses of the cell, generating energy through cellular respiration, while the cytoplasm serves as the gel-like substance that holds the cell together and provides a medium for various cellular processes.",
    "2700": "The answer is A. The statement \"Shawn's friend taught him how to fly a kite\" provides evidence that Shawn acquired the ability to fly a kite through learning or instruction from another person, which is a common way to acquire new skills or traits. Options B and C do not directly support the conclusion that Shawn acquired the trait of being able to fly a kite; they provide unrelated information about repairing a kite and flying it with a sibling, respectively.\n",

    "2724": "The answer is B. A population refers to all the members of a particular species living in a specific area. In this case, the flock of greater flamingos is a population because it consists of all the greater flamingos living in the Camargue wetlands. The other options describe different aspects of the ecosystem but do not represent a population of a single species.\n",
    "2727": "The answer is A.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring: FF, Ff, ff, and Ff. Out of these, only one combination results in long fur (ff). Therefore, the probability that a cat produced by this cross will have long fur is 1/4.\n",
    "2733": "The answer is A. \n\nA simple sentence contains only one independent clause, meaning it has one subject and one predicate. Option A is a simple sentence because it has one subject (\"Mr. Lowery's afternoon lecture\") and one predicate (\"was about art and culture in Germany before World War II\"). Option B is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"or\" and has two subjects (\"We\" and \"we\") and two predicates (\"can install the software now\" and \"can wait until next week\").\n",

    "2754": "The answer is A. the snowboards with wax removed\n\nIn the experiment described, Jeanette alternated between riding with and without wax on the snowboards. This means that the snowboards with wax removed served as the control group in the experiment. The control group is the group that does not receive the experimental treatment, allowing researchers to compare the results of the experimental group (the snowboards with wax added) to the control group. By comparing the times it took for Jeanette to ride down the hill with and without wax, researchers can determine if the application of wax had any effect on the speed of the snowboarders.\n",
    "2761": "The answer is A. The barrel cactus is a producer in its ecosystem because it makes its own food through photosynthesis, using energy from sunlight to produce glucose. This process allows the cactus to survive and grow without relying on other organisms for sustenance. On the other hand, the crown-of-thorns starfish is a consumer in its ecosystem as it feeds on other organisms like coral, which means it does not produce its own food but instead obtains nutrients by consuming other living things.\n",

    "2833": "The answer is A. The sentence uses a metaphor to describe Mrs. Shelton as being kind and having a heart that is like gold. Metaphors compare two things by saying one thing is another, while similes compare two things by using \"like\" or \"as.\" In this case, the sentence is comparing Mrs. Shelton's kindness to the quality of gold, which is a metaphorical comparison rather than a literal one.",
    "2838": "The answer is A. The description of the red-headed poison frogs matches all three traits mentioned: they spend part of their lives in water and part on land, they have moist skin, and they make eggs with no shells. The Canadian lynx, on the other hand, does not have moist skin or lay eggs without shells, so it does not meet the criteria for being an amphibian.\n",

This adaptation allows the Siberian tiger to hunt and move around easily in its snowy habitat.\n",
    "2875": "The answer is B. The title of a book should be written with proper capitalization and punctuation. In this case, \"There's a Wocket in My Pocket!\" is the correct title format as it includes proper capitalization and an exclamation mark to indicate excitement or emphasis, which is appropriate for the title of a children's book. Option A does not include proper capitalization and punctuation, making it incorrect.",
    "2879": "The answer is B. \"With love,\" Dana.\n",
    "2889": "The answer is C. 4 feet. \n\nA sofa typically measures around 8 to 9 feet in length, so 4 feet would be an underestimate. 4 yards is equivalent to 12 feet, which is also too short for a typical sofa. 4 miles is an extremely long distance, far beyond the length of any sofa. Therefore, option C, 4 feet, is the best estimate among the given options.",

    "3019": "The answer is B. Lasagna typically takes around 30-45 minutes to bake in the oven, depending on the thickness of the lasagna and the specific recipe being followed. Therefore, option B (39 minutes) is a more accurate estimate than option A (39 hours).",
    "3023": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred by observing that the magnets in Pair 1 are smaller than the magnets in Pair 2. Since the size of the magnets affects their magnetic strength, it is reasonable to assume that the larger magnets in Pair 2 will exert a stronger magnetic force compared to the smaller magnets in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.\n",

    "3160": "The answer is D. Both are caused by heating.\n\nExplanation: Carving a piece of wood involves using tools to remove material from the wood, which is a physical change as it does not alter the chemical composition of the wood. However, the process can be influenced by heat if the carving tool is heated to make it sharper or more effective. Water boiling on a stove is a chemical change because water molecules break down into hydrogen and oxygen gases during the boiling process. Both processes involve heating as a cause, even though they result in different types of changes.\n",

    "3176": "The answer is D. 2/4.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring: HH, HH, Hh, and Hh. Two of these combinations (Hh and Hh) are heterozygous, meaning they have one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h). Therefore, the probability that a pea plant produced by this cross will be heterozygous for the stem height gene is 2 out of 4, or 2/4.\n",
    "3177": "The answer is B. Kenneth's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is \"mm\" because he has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease, which means he has the recessive allele \"m\" twice. Since the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m) is dominant over the allele for having Thomsen disease (M), Kenneth would be considered to have the phenotype of not having Thomsen disease.",
    "3183": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Elena and her brother rummaged through the boxes in the attic, but they couldn't find their father's childhood baseball glove,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"but.\" This makes it a compound sentence.

    "3909": "The answer is B. \n\nThe Serengeti National Park is located in Tanzania, a country in eastern Africa. Eastern Africa experiences a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, the area receives heavy rainfall, while during the dry season, there is little to no precipitation. This seasonal pattern affects the vegetation and wildlife in the region, as plants grow more abundantly during the wet season and animals migrate or adapt their behavior to find food and water during the dry season.\n\nIn addition to the seasonal climate, the soil in the Serengeti National Park is generally poor in nutrients. This is due to the high temperatures and frequent rains, which cause rapid decomposition of organic matter and leaching of nutrients from the soil. As a result, the soil is often low in fertility, which can limit plant growth and affect the availability of food for herbivores and carnivores in the ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best description of the Serengeti National Park ecosystem, as it accurately reflects both the seasonal climate and the nutrient-poor soil conditions in the region.\n",

    "5079": "The answer is D. Dominica.\n",
    "5085": "The answer is C. A rounded body.\n\nBased on the image, we can see that the fossil of Tripneustes has a rounded shape, which suggests that it had a rounded body. The other options, such as white spines or a reddish-orange body, cannot be observed directly on the fossil since they are not visible in the image. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer to the question.\n",
    "5088": "The answer is E.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the offspring: Hh, hh, Hh, and hh. Since the allele for not having Huntington's disease (h) is recessive, only the hh combination will result in offspring without the disease. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to offspring that have Huntington's disease is 1:3.\n",
    "5089": "The answer is B. Bilberry is a producer because it is at the base of the food web and is consumed by other organisms such as the Arctic fox and the collared lemming. Producers are organisms that can produce their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, and they form the foundation of the food web.",
    "5094": "The answer is C. scratchy.\n\nAll three objects - cactus, potato sack, and velcro - share the property of being scratchy to some degree. The spines of the cactus can be sharp and uncomfortable to touch, the rough texture of the potato sack can cause irritation if rubbed against the skin, and the hook-and-loop fastener of velcro can also be scratchy to the touch.

    "5108": "The answer is A. Each cake . . . the surroundings\n\nDuring the time shown in the table, the temperature of both cakes decreased. This indicates that thermal energy was transferred from the cakes to their surroundings, as the cakes were cooling down. The decrease in temperature suggests that heat was being lost from the cakes to the environment around them, such as the air or surfaces they were placed on.",
    "5114": "The answer is A. Barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the arrow points from the bilberry to the barren-ground caribou, indicating that the barren-ground caribou consumes the bilberry. Therefore, the barren-ground caribou contains matter that was once part of the bilberry.\n",
    "5130": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"terribly\" is used to describe the intensity of Zach's shivering due to the cold, which aligns with its traditional sense of describing something as extremely or severely. Option B uses \"terribly\" to modify the adjective \"steep,\" which is not its traditional usage. Therefore, option A correctly uses the word \"terribly\" in its traditional sense.\n",
    "5132": "The answer is C. Metal flute is generally considered to be the scratchiest among the options given, as it can produce a rough or abrasive sound when played, especially if the player is not skilled or if the instrument is not well-maintained. Bark and nylon swim shorts are not typically associated with producing a scratchy sound.",
    "5136": "The answer is A. Whether the filter was clogged.\n",
    "5149": "The answer is B. Physical change.

With these supplies, he can investigate the effect of different types of soil on the growth of tomato plants. Therefore, option C is the correct choice as it directly relates to using the available supplies to test the impact of soil type on tomato plant growth.\n",
    "5167": "The answer is B. \n\nBased on the information provided, Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene. Since the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l), Dasher will express the dominant phenotype, which is a black coat. Therefore, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat.",
    "5178": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (S-N), which means they will repel each other. In Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-N or S-S), which means they will attract each other. Since attraction is stronger than repulsion, the magnetic force in Pair 2 is stronger than in Pair 1.\n",

    "5197": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"Miguel will lend us money for the tickets if we promise to repay him by the end of the year,\" there is an independent clause (\"Miguel will lend us money for the tickets\") and a dependent clause (\"if we promise to repay him by the end of the year\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the independent clause) and one subordinate idea (the dependent clause).\n\nOption B, \"Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., won him a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects,\" is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause with no dependent clauses.\n",
    "5206": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5219": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"he\" could refer to either Danny or Adam, making it unclear who will be letting Susan know. This creates a vague pronoun reference. Option B clearly states that Danny will be the one to inform Susan, so there is no ambiguity in the pronoun reference.\n",
    "5230": "The answer is B. 5 pounds. \n\nThis is because a full bag of groceries typically weighs around 5 pounds, which is a common weight for such items in grocery stores. 5 ounces would be too light, and 5 tons would be far too heavy for a typical grocery bag.",
    "5235": "The answer is B. Connecticut.\n",
    "5242": "The answer is A - shortage.\n\nExplanation: There is a shortage of bunk beds because the number of people who want to buy bunk beds (15) exceeds the number of bunk beds available for sale (20). This means that if all 15 people were able to purchase a bunk bed, there would be no bunk beds left in stock. Therefore, there is a shortage of bunk beds.\n",

    "5268": "The answer is A. A 250-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 10\u00b0C has the most thermal energy because it is warmer than the other options. Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the more thermal energy it possesses. Therefore, option A has the highest temperature among the three choices, making it the object with the most thermal energy.\n",
    "5283": "The answer is B. Since both options describe a 250-gram glass of grape juice, the difference in thermal energy between them would be due to the difference in temperature. The object with the lower temperature (10\u00b0C) will have less thermal energy compared to the one with the higher temperature (15\u00b0C). Therefore, option B has less thermal energy.",
    "5289": "The answer is A. It has cold, wet winters. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.\n\nThe Monongahela National Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem, which means it experiences warm summers and cold, wet winters. The soil in this type of forest is often poor in nutrients due to the rapid decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms. This can make it difficult for plants to grow and thrive, but it also helps to maintain the biodiversity of the ecosystem by promoting the growth of a variety of plant species. Therefore, option A better describes the Monongahela National Forest ecosystem.\n",
    "5290": "The answer is B.",
    "5291": "The answer is A. Echo's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait is \"not having myotonia congenita.\" Since Echo has two alleles for not having myotonia congenita (mm), it means that Echo does not exhibit the trait of having myotonia congenita.",
    "5292": "The answer is B. Neon (Ne) is an elementary substance because it consists of only one type of atom, neon atoms. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and fluoromethanol (CH3FO) are compounds, as they contain more than one type of atom bonded together.",
    "5295": "The answer is B. opaque.\n\nAll four objects - road, water slide, crayons, and track suit - are opaque, meaning that they do not allow light to pass through them. This means that you cannot see through any of these objects, as they block the light that would otherwise pass through them.",
    "5296": "The answer is A. Carson City.\n",
    "5297": "The answer is B. The trait of having five fingers on each hand is an inherited trait because it is determined by the genes that were passed down from her parents during her conception. These genes dictate the development of her body parts, including the number of fingers she has. Since Patty was born with five fingers on each hand, it is likely that she inherited this trait from her parents.",
    "5303": "The answer is B. \"Best wishes for an enjoyable Independence Day from the entire staff at Myra's Cafe\" is more formal than \"Happy 4th from the crew at Myra's.\" The second option uses more polite language and includes the full name of the establishment, making it more appropriate for a formal greeting.",
    "5315": "The answer is B. Attract\n\nExplanation: Opposite poles of magnets attract each other. In the image, the north pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other magnet. Since opposite poles attract, the magnets will attract each other.\n",

The allusion in the sentence refers to Romeo, a character from William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet.\" The term \"Romeo\" is used here to describe someone who is charming or attractive to women, often in a flirtatious or romantic way. This allusion comes from literature, specifically from Shakespeare's work.\n",
    "5327": "The answer is C. Preston can investigate whether the pet lizard is more active when its tank is heated with one heating lamp or with two heating lamps using the available supplies. This experiment would help him understand if temperature affects the lizard's activity level. Options A and B involve feeding the lizard different types of food, which is not directly related to the heating lamps in the given context.",
    "5330": "The answer is B. A cookie at a temperature of 29\u00b0C has the most thermal energy because it is the hottest among the three options provided. Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy its particles possess, resulting in greater thermal energy. Therefore, the cookie with the highest temperature will have the most thermal energy.",
    "5340": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 2 are smaller than the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force between two magnets depends on their size and distance apart, the smaller magnets in Pair 2 will experience a weaker magnetic force compared to the larger magnets in Pair 1. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n",
    "5344": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5345": "The answer is C. Complex.\n\nThis sentence is considered complex because it contains an independent clause (\"Since it takes approximately one thousand years for a used printer cartridge to decompose\") and a dependent clause (\"recycling these plastic ink dispensers helps the environment\"). The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence, but together they form a single, more complex thought or idea.\n",
    "5350": "The answer is A. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs because all the magnets are made of the same material and they are separated by the same distance. The orientation of the magnets does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force, only its direction. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.\n",
    "5353": "The answer is B. Silk is not a pure substance and it is made by living things, so it does not fit the definition of a mineral. Minerals are inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and crystalline structure, whereas silk is an organic material produced by living organisms.",
    "5357": "The answer is A. Dinosaur footprint.\n\nIn the diagram, the dinosaur footprint is located in the deeper layer of the sedimentary rock sequence, while the insect fossil is found in the shallower layer. Since the deeper layers are typically older than the shallower ones due to the process of sedimentation, it can be inferred that the dinosaur footprint is younger than the insect fossil.\n",
    "5360": "The answer is A. the bottles with lids kept on\n\nIn this experiment, the experimental group refers to the group of subjects or objects that receive the treatment or intervention being tested. In this case, Steve wanted to determine if removing the carbon dioxide from the soda would cause the popsicles to freeze more quickly. Therefore, the experimental group would be the bottles with lids kept on, as they received the treatment by keeping the carbon dioxide inside the soda. The control group, on the other hand, would be the bottles with lids taken off, as they did not receive the treatment and served as a comparison to the experimental group.\n",

    "5377": "The answer is B. A jack-o'-lantern rotting in the sun is an example of a physical change because it involves changes in the appearance or properties of the pumpkin without altering its fundamental composition. The process of decomposition due to sunlight exposure does not create new substances but rather causes the breakdown of existing ones, leading to changes like color fading, softening, and eventual decay. This is different from a chemical change where new substances are formed with distinct properties.\n",
    "5379": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option A, \"nauseous\" is used to describe something that causes nausea, which is its modern usage. In option B, \"nauseous\" is used in its traditional sense to mean causing nausea or feeling sick to one's stomach. Therefore, option B correctly uses the word \"nauseous\" in its traditional sense.\n",
    "5384": "The answer is B. Bumble bees are insects, which are invertebrates. The other options (American crocodile, hummingbird, and lion) are vertebrates as they have backbones.\n",
    "5397": "The answer is B. The text uses a red herring fallacy by introducing an unrelated topic (the number of off-leash dogs) to divert attention from the actual issue being discussed, which is making the streets safe by addressing the dog problem. This makes it seem like the solution to the dog problem will also address the issue of crime, which is not necessarily true.\n",
    "5402": "The answer is C. Both are caused by heating.\n\nIn both scenarios, heat is applied to cause a change:\n- Water boiling on a stove involves heating water until it reaches its boiling point, where it changes from a liquid to a gas (steam).\n- Baking an apple pie involves heating the oven to a specific temperature, causing the ingredients inside the pie to cook and transform into a baked dish.\n\nThese processes involve heating as the primary cause of the changes observed, making option C the correct choice.",
    "5406": "The answer is D. South Carolina.\n",
    "5411": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are closer together compared to Pair 2 where they are farther apart. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the magnetic force will be stronger in Pair 1 because the magnets are closer together. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n",
    "5435": "The answer is D. Madagascar day gecko.",
    "5436": "The answer is D. 2,245 kilometers.\n\nThis is because the Red Sea is a large body of water that stretches across a considerable distance. Among the given options, kilometers is the most appropriate unit to measure such a vast geographical feature. Centimeters, meters, and millimeters are too small units to accurately represent the length of the Red Sea. Therefore, option D, 2,245 kilometers, is the best estimate for the length of the Red Sea.\n",
    "5438": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, it is customary to use the full name with the correct capitalization in the greeting of a letter. Therefore, \"Dear Mr. Stephenson\" is the correct choice as it includes the full name and capitalizes the first letter of each word. Option A only uses the last name without capitalizing the first letter, making it less formal and potentially incorrect depending on the specific style guide being followed.",
    "5445": "The answer is A.\n",

    "5544": "The answer is B. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. According to the inverse square law, the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Therefore, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller, the magnetic force between them will be stronger compared to the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "5546": "The answer is A. Since both objects have the same mass (250 grams), the one with the lower temperature (90\u00b0F) will have less thermal energy compared to the one with the higher temperature (95\u00b0F). Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; as the temperature increases, so does the thermal energy. Therefore, option A, the mug of cocoa at 90\u00b0F, has less thermal energy than the mug of cocoa at 95\u00b0F.",
    "5549": "The answer is A. Arctic fox.\n\nAn omnivore is an organism that eats both plants and animals. In the food web provided, the Arctic fox is shown to eat both the collared lemming (an animal) and the bilberry (a plant).

Since all three options refer to bowls of oatmeal, we can assume that they contain the same amount of food and thus the same amount of heat capacity. Therefore, the bowl of oatmeal at 101\u00b0F would have the least thermal energy compared to the other two options, as it has the lowest temperature among them.\n",
    "5556": "The answer is A. \n\nOption A provides evidence that both Susan's biological parents have red hair, and Susan herself has red hair. This suggests that Susan may have inherited the trait of red hair from her parents, as traits are often passed down through generations within families. However, it is important to note that this does not definitively prove that Susan inherited the trait, as other factors such as environmental influences or mutations can also play a role in determining hair color. Option B only mentions Susan's mother's hairstyle preference, which is not relevant to the inheritance of hair color. Option C only mentions that Susan's neighbor has straight hair, which does not provide any information about Susan's genetic background or how she inherited her hair trait. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice to support the conclusion that Susan inherited the trait of straight hair.\n",
    "5565": "The answer is A. Dover.\n",
    "5572": "The answer is A. The initial temperatures of both aquariums were the same, but their final temperatures were lower than the surrounding room temperature. This indicates that thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each aquarium, causing the water inside to cool down.",
    "5575": "The answer is A. The plant has the homozygous genotype ff, which means it has two recessive alleles for fuzzy fruit. Since the allele for fuzzy fruit (f) is recessive and there are no dominant alleles present, the plant will express the recessive trait, resulting in fuzzy fruit as its phenotype.\n",
    "5579": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.\n\nThis can be inferred by observing that all the magnets are made of the same material, so they have the same magnetic properties. Additionally, the distance between the magnets in each pair is the same, as indicated by the 4-inch scale. Since the material and distance are constant, the only variable affecting the magnetic force would be the size and shape of the magnets. However, since the magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same size and shape, their magnetic forces should be equal.\n",
    "5586": "The answer is B.\n",
    "5588": "The answer is A.\n\nIn option A, \"this sweatshirt\" could refer to either David or Eric, making it unclear who the sweatshirt belongs to. This creates a vague pronoun reference. Option B uses the pronoun \"his,\" which clearly refers to one of the two people mentioned in the sentence, thus avoiding the vagueness present in option A.\n",
    "5590": "The answer is A. \n\nSince Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene, and the allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i), Kraken will express the dominant trait, which is a spotted tail. Therefore, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait is a spotted tail.\n",
    "5591": "The answer is B. 30 grams. \n\nThis is because a small candy bar typically weighs much less than 30 kilograms, which would be an unusually large amount for such a small item.

    "5872": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the information provided, Salem has the homozygous genotype aa for the agouti fur gene. Since the allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive, Salem will express the recessive phenotype, which means Salem does not have agouti fur. Therefore, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait is \"not having agouti fur.\"\n",
    "5873": "The answer is B.\n",
    "5883": "The answer is C. The fast-food restaurant is located in row C.\n",
    "5884": "The answer is B. Feather.\n\nIn the diagram, the feather fossil is located in the top layer of the undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence, while the crocodile egg fossil is found in the bottom layer. Since the top layer represents shallower water and the bottom layer represents deeper water, it can be inferred that the feather fossil is younger than the crocodile egg fossil. This is because the feather fossil was deposited closer to the surface of the water, where it would have been exposed to less pressure and erosion compared to the crocodile egg fossil, which was buried deeper in the sedimentary rock sequence.\n",
    "5902": "The answer is B.",
    "5911": "The answer is B. The word \"softly\" would not be found between the guide words \"seventh\" and \"sting\" because it does not fall within the alphabetical range that these words represent.

    "5921": "The answer is D. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four squares contain the genotype \"Bb\". Since the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b), any offspring with the genotype \"Bb\" will have a normal-sized body. Therefore, the probability that a rat produced by this cross will have a dwarf body is 0 out of 4, or 0/4.",
    "5923": "The answer is A. The statement \"The Phantom of the Opera became the longest running show in Broadway history on January 9, 2006\" is a fact because it provides specific information about an event that occurred on a particular date.

    "5941": "The answer is A. \n\nSince the plant has the homozygous genotype \"ff\" for the fruit color gene, it means that both alleles are recessive (f). According to the given information, the allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f). Therefore, the presence of two recessive alleles (ff) results in the recessive phenotype, which is green fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait is green fruit.\n",
    "5945": "The answer is B. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the implication that it is quiet. The phrase \"as quiet as a jackhammer\" is used to emphasize how loud the snoring is, making it ironic because jackhammers are known for their extremely loud noise.",

    "5962": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, the pronoun \"his\" is used to refer to Gary, but it is not clear whether it refers to Gary's arm or Dave's arm. This creates a vague pronoun reference because the reader cannot determine with certainty which arm was injured. Option A does not have a vague pronoun reference as the pronoun \"he\" clearly refers to Gary.\n",
    "5964": "The answer is A. Kansas is farthest north among the given options.\n",
    "5974": "The answer is B. 3 gallons. \n\nThis is because a typical bathroom sink can hold around 3 gallons of water, which is equivalent to approximately 11.4 liters or 3785.41 cubic centimeters. This is a reasonable estimate for the volume of a standard bathroom sink, as it would be large enough to accommodate a person washing their hands or face but not so large that it would be impractical to fill with water. The other options, such as 3 fluid ounces or 3 cups, are much smaller than the volume of a typical bathroom sink.",
    "5982": "The answer is A.\n",
    "5984": "The answer is B. Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific location, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. On the other hand, climate describes the long-term patterns of weather in a particular area, including average temperatures, rainfall, and other factors that occur over an extended period.

This experiment would allow him to compare the drying rates under different environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and air circulation, which could influence the rate of evaporation and drying of the towels. \n\nTo conduct the experiment, Todd should hang one towel in the laundry room and another towel in the backyard, ensuring both towels are exposed to similar conditions except for their location. He should then observe and record the time it takes for each towel to reach a certain level of dryness, such as being completely dry or having a specific percentage of moisture remaining. By comparing the drying times between the two locations, Todd can determine if there is a significant difference in the drying rates due to the environment.\n",
    "6021": "The answer is A. The sentence uses a metaphor to compare Scooter, the dog, to a security guard. This comparison is made by saying that Scooter \"is\" the security guard, which is a figurative way of describing his role in protecting the front yard mailbox. A simile would involve using words like \"like\" or \"as\" to make the comparison, such as \"Scooter is like a security guard.\"",
    "6024": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Isaac and his siblings share the same trait, which could indicate that they inherited it from their parents. However, it does not provide direct evidence of Isaac inheriting the trait from his parents. Option C also does not provide direct evidence of Isaac inheriting the trait from his father. Option A provides indirect evidence that Isaac's mother has naturally brown hair, but it does not directly support the conclusion that Isaac inherited the trait from her.

Option A provides a plausible explanation for how Jessica might have acquired her knitting skills, while option B describes an action related to the trait but does not directly explain how she acquired it.\n",
    "6061": "The answer is A. False dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist. Dave is making a binary choice between voting for the Conservative Party or the Labour Party, but there could be other political parties or independent candidates that he might consider as well. This limits his options and makes it seem like there is no middle ground or other viable choices available.\n",
    "6063": "The answer is A. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite words to create a paradoxical effect. In this case, \"open secret\" is an oxymoron because \"open\" implies something that is known by many people, while \"secret\" implies something that is kept hidden. The phrase suggests that Emilio's book is widely known among his friends despite him not talking about it, creating a paradoxical situation where the book is both known and unknown simultaneously.\n",

    "6080": "The answer is A. Malayan colugo.\n\nThe Malayan colugo is a small, nocturnal mammal native to Southeast Asia. It is known for its unique ability to glide through the air using a membrane of skin that stretches between its limbs. This adaptation allows the colugo to move quickly and efficiently between trees, much like a flying squirrel or a flying fox. The colugo's limbs are specially adapted for this purpose, with long fingers and toes that help it grip onto branches and other surfaces while it glides. The colugo's wings are also very flexible, allowing it to change direction mid-flight and make precise landings. Overall, the Malayan colugo is a fascinating example of how animals can evolve to adapt to their environment and take advantage of unique opportunities for survival.\n",

    "6119": "The answer is C. \n\nThe statement \"Jayden's biological parents have wavy hair\" provides evidence that Jayden may have inherited the wavy hair trait from them. This is because traits are often passed down through generations in families due to genetic inheritance. If both of Jayden's parents have wavy hair, it suggests that they carry the gene responsible for wavy hair, and there is a higher likelihood that Jayden inherited this gene from one or both of them. However, it's important to note that other factors can influence hair texture, such as environmental conditions and personal care practices, so while genetics play a role, they don't always determine the final outcome.\n",

    "6419": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (S-N), which means they will attract each other. However, in Pair 2, the magnets are facing like poles towards each other (N-S and S-N), which means they will repel each other. Since attraction and repulsion are both forms of magnetic force, the strength of the magnetic force would be the same in both pairs. However, since the direction of the force is different (attractive vs. repulsive), the effect of the force would be different. Therefore, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 because the magnets are attracting each other instead of repelling each other.\n",

Both are only physical changes.\n\nBreaking a stick in half involves changing its shape without altering its fundamental composition or creating new substances, making it a physical change. Similarly, mixing sand and gravel also does not create new substances; it merely combines different materials together, which is another example of a physical change. Neither process involves any chemical reactions that would result in the formation of new compounds with different properties than the original materials. Therefore, both actions are classified as physical changes.",

    "6833": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nThis is because Russell's naturally straight hair is likely due to his genetic makeup, which is passed down from his parents. Since the trait is present in Russell, it can be inferred that he inherited it from one or both of his parents. Therefore, the trait of naturally straight hair is considered an inherited trait.\n",
    "6836": "The answer is B. Solid coloring.\n\nBased on the information provided, Ace has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene. Since the allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a), Ace will express the dominant phenotype, which in this case is solid coloring. Therefore, Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is solid coloring.",
    "6839": "The answer is B. The scar on Nina's right leg is an acquired trait because it was likely caused by an accident or injury that occurred during her lifetime, rather than being passed down through her genes from her parents.",
    "6840": "The answer is B. The metaphor \"a roller coaster of emotions\" suggests that Tanvi experienced a range of different feelings or emotions in response to the news, just as one would experience a variety of sensations while riding a roller coaster. This implies that her emotions were not consistent or uniform, but rather fluctuated and changed throughout the time she was processing the news.",
    "6855": "The answer is C. Carson City.\n",
    "6864": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, it is customary to use a comma after the salutation in a letter.

    "6896": "The answer is A. The male part of a flower, known as the anther, produces pollen. The anther is located at the top of the stamen in a flower, and it contains the pollen grains that will eventually fertilize the ovules in the pistil to produce seeds. The female part of a flower, known as the pistil, receives the pollen and facilitates its transfer to the ovules for fertilization.\n",
    "6898": "The answer is A. It would take approximately 50 hours to drain all of the water in a full bathtub, assuming that the drain is functioning properly and there are no obstructions. This is because a typical bathtub can hold around 40-70 gallons of water, and a standard household faucet can drain about 2-3 gallons per minute. Therefore, it would take between 13 and 23 minutes to drain one gallon of water, and it would take around 50 hours to drain all of the water in a full bathtub.\n",
    "6909": "The answer is B. Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat because he has the homozygous genotype LL, which means he has two copies of the dominant allele L for a black coat. Since the allele for a red coat (l) is recessive, it would only be expressed if both alleles were l, which is not the case here. Therefore, Boxer will have a black coat as his phenotype.",
    "6911": "The answer is B. The allusion in the sentence \"Ernest's Falstaffian nature makes him stand out at a party\" refers to Falstaff, a character from William Shakespeare's plays, particularly \"Henry IV Part I\" and \"Henry IV Part II.\" Falstaff is known for his joviality, gluttony, and his role as a comic foil to the more serious characters in the play. Therefore, the source of the allusion is Shakespeare.\n",
    "6918": "The answer is A.\n",
    "6933": "The answer is B. \n\nThis is because the poem by Jane Taylor, \"The Violet,\" describes a modest violet growing within a green and shady bed, with its stalk bent and hanging its head as if trying to hide from view.

    "6969": "The answer is B. Marsh terrapin.\n\nThe marsh terrapin has a hard outer shell that protects it from predators with sharp teeth. This adaptation allows the marsh terrapin to pull its soft parts into its shell when attacked, providing an additional layer of protection. In contrast, the ring-necked pheasant does not have a hard outer shell, making it more vulnerable to predators with sharp teeth.\n",
    "6972": "The answer is B. Physical change.\n\nExplanation: When cracks form in concrete due to changes in temperature, it is because the material undergoes a change in its physical properties without altering its chemical composition. This is a characteristic of a physical change. In contrast, a chemical change involves a transformation where new substances with different chemical compositions are formed. Since the concrete does not become a different substance but rather experiences a change in its structure or appearance, it indicates a physical change.",
    "6973": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"He won't get lost, I will give him directions\" is a run-on sentence because it combines two independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions to separate them. It should be written as two separate sentences: \"He won't get lost.

While they can also be stored by organisms for later use, their main function is to supply energy rather than storing genetic information or controlling chemical reactions. \n\nOption A refers to nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, which store genetic information and are responsible for directing growth and development. Option C refers to enzymes, which play a role in controlling chemical reactions within cells but are not themselves carbohydrates.",
    "7058": "The answer is B. False dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist. The statement \"If you're not a vegetarian, then you must despise animals\" implies that there are only two possible positions - being a vegetarian or despising animals - without considering other possibilities such as being a flexitarian, a pescatarian, or simply not having strong feelings towards animals. This limits the range of potential beliefs and opinions, making it a false dichotomy.\n",
    "7066": "The answer is C. This is a declarative sentence because it makes a statement about moss hanging from the branches of a bald cypress tree.

The allusion in the sentence \"In response to his position on taxes, some journalists accused the candidate of engaging in doublethink\" comes from George Orwell's novel \"1984.\" Doublethink refers to the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs simultaneously without experiencing cognitive dissonance. This concept is central to the narrative of \"1984,\" where the government of Oceania enforces a totalitarian regime that manipulates reality through propaganda and surveillance. Therefore, the source of the allusion is literature, specifically George Orwell's work.\n",
    "7294": "The answer is C. Australia.\n",
    "7296": "The answer is B.\n\nThe magnets will attract each other because opposite poles attract. In the image, one magnet has its south pole facing the north pole of the other magnet, which means they are attracting each other.\n",
    "7297": "The answer is B. Euphemism is a figure of speech that uses mild or indirect language instead of potentially offensive or blunt language. In this case, the phrase \"stay away from the ocean\" is a euphemism for \"don't go swimming.\" It is a more polite way of telling Jennifer to avoid going into the water without knowing how to swim.",
    "7298": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, the word \"unique\" is used in its traditional sense to describe each item in Samantha's collection individually, reflecting their distinct characteristics and artistic styles. This usage aligns with the original meaning of the word, which refers to something that is one-of-a-kind or different from others.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, uses the word \"unique\" in a more figurative sense, referring to Samantha herself as an exceptional artist. This usage is more common in modern language and does not strictly adhere to the traditional definition of the word.\n",
    "7326": "The answer is A. The word \"crumb\" would be found between the guide words \"cattle\" and \"code\" in a dictionary because it comes alphabetically after \"cattle\" but before \"code\".",

    "7389": "The answer is B. The text uses an ad hominem fallacy by attacking Mr. Conway personally rather than addressing his argument about workplace safety. The statement \"I doubt that someone so socially awkward would know a thing about office safety\" is a personal attack on Mr. Conway's character, rather than focusing on the validity of his argument or the evidence he presents. This type of reasoning is known as an ad hominem fallacy because it diverts attention from the actual issue at hand to irrelevant personal attacks.\n",
    "7391": "The answer is B. A drum is considered a good because it is a physical object that can be bought, sold, and owned. It is not a service, which refers to an action or activity performed for someone else, such as cleaning, cooking, or providing transportation.\n",

Appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good.\n\nIn the given text, the argument is based on the idea that since ancient ancestors ran without shoes, running shoes must not be beneficial for modern-day people. This is an example of appealing to nature, as it assumes that because something was done naturally in the past, it is inherently better or more appropriate today. It does not consider other factors such as modern technology, physical conditions, or individual needs that may make running shoes more advantageous for contemporary joggers.",
    "7442": "The answer is A. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between the magnets increases, so the force is weaker in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1.\n",
    "7443": "The answer is C. Black racer.\n\nIn the food web, the black racer is shown to be preyed upon by the bobcat. Therefore, any matter contained within the black racer will eventually move to the bobcat as it consumes the black racer. The parasol fungus is shown to be preyed upon by the black racer, so any matter contained within the parasol fungus will eventually move to the black racer as it consumes the parasol fungus. Thus, the matter contained within the parasol fungus will eventually move to the black racer, and then to the bobcat.\n",
    "7448": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- Making paper from wood involves breaking down wood fibers into pulp and then recombining them to form sheets of paper. This process includes chemical reactions that break down lignin and other components of the wood to make it suitable for paper production. Therefore, making paper from wood is a chemical change.\n- Rusting is the formation of iron oxide (rust) on the surface of iron or steel due to exposure to oxygen and moisture. This process involves oxidation, which is a chemical reaction where iron atoms lose electrons and combine with oxygen to form rust. Thus, rusting is also a chemical change.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions, so they share the characteristic of being chemical changes.",

    "7459": "The answer is B. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or opposite terms, such as \"jacket\" and \"genuine imitation leather.\" In this case, the term \"genuine imitation leather\" is an oxymoron because \"genuine\" implies authenticity while \"imitation\" suggests a fake or artificial product. The salesperson is using this oxymoron to emphasize the quality of the jacket, even though it is not truly made of genuine leather.\n",
    "7460": "The answer is B. Climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather conditions in an area, while weather describes short-term changes in temperature, humidity, cloudiness, precipitation, etc. In this case, Joey living in a city where the wind often blows from the south throughout the year is describing a long-term pattern, making it a statement about the climate rather than the weather.\n",
    "7461": "The answer is B.\n\nIn the image, there are two magnets placed side by side with their opposite poles facing each other. One magnet has its north pole (N) facing the south pole (S) of the other magnet, while the other magnet has its south pole (S) facing the north pole (N) of the first magnet. Since opposite poles attract each other, these magnets will attract each other.\n",

    "7583": "The answer is A. With the given supplies, Suzie can investigate whether small rocks or large rocks skip more times when thrown across the river. This is because she has access to both small and large flat rocks, allowing her to compare their skipping abilities. However, she does not have any round rocks, so she cannot investigate the difference between round and flat rocks. Additionally, she does not have access to a pond, so she cannot compare skipping behavior between a river and a pond. Therefore, option A is the most suitable question for her to investigate using the available supplies.\n",
    "7596": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"terribly\" is used to describe the intensity or severity of Raymond's shivering, which aligns with its traditional meaning of being very bad, severe, or intense.

    "7650": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 1 are larger than the magnets in Pair 2. Larger magnets generally have a stronger magnetic field, resulting in a greater magnetic force between them compared to smaller magnets with the same shape and material. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic properties are similar, so the size difference is the main factor affecting the magnetic force between them. Therefore, the larger magnets in Pair 1 will exert a greater magnetic force on each other compared to the smaller magnets in Pair 2.\n",
    "7654": "The answer is B. Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific location, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. On the other hand, climate describes the long-term patterns of weather in a particular area, including average temperatures, rainfall, and other factors that occur over an extended period.

This decrease in height results in a corresponding decrease in the gravitational potential energy stored between the balloon and the Earth.",
    "7718": "The answer is C. The netleaf oak trees, the Mexican spotted owls, and the brush mice form a community within the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range. A community refers to all the living organisms that share an environment and interact with each other, while the other options only include one or two components of the ecosystem without considering their interactions with each other.\n",
    "7723": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the size of the magnets affects their magnetic strength. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields than smaller ones. In Pair 2, the magnets are larger compared to those in Pair 1, so they will exert a stronger magnetic force on each other. Therefore, the statement that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 is true.\n",

    "7739": "The answer is B. How steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\n\nMarshall's test involved putting a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel and observing its movement at a speed of 200 km per hour. This test would allow him to determine how steady the parachute was at this specific speed, as he was concerned about the potential for the parachute to swing wildly and damage the spacecraft. The test does not provide information about the parachute's performance at different speeds or whether the spacecraft would be damaged by using the parachute with a 1 m vent at 200 km per hour. Therefore, options A and C are incorrect.\n",
    "7742": "The answer is B.\n",
    "7745": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the distance between the magnets is shorter than in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnetic force will be stronger in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2.\n",
    "7747": "The answer is C. As the water balloon falls towards Sandeep, its height relative to the ground decreases, resulting in a decrease in its gravitational potential energy. This is because gravitational potential energy is directly proportional to the height of an object above a reference point, such as the ground. Therefore, as the water balloon descends, its gravitational potential energy decreases.\n",
    "7748": "The answer is A. \n\nThis option suggests that Gabriel's parents had straight hair, which implies they likely passed the trait of having straight hair to Gabriel through their genes. This is a common way traits are inherited in genetics, where parents' characteristics can be passed down to their offspring. Option B does not provide any information about the inheritance of the trait; it only states that Gabriel and his father both have short hair, which doesn't necessarily indicate that the trait was inherited.",
    "7755": "The answer is C. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- A penny tarnishing involves the oxidation of copper in the penny, which is a chemical reaction that results in the formation of a different compound (copper oxide). This is a chemical change because it involves a transformation of one substance into another.\n- Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln involves the firing process, where the clay undergoes a series of chemical reactions, including dehydration, vitrification, and sintering, to transform the clay into a ceramic material. This is also a chemical change as it involves the conversion of one substance (clay) into another (ceramic).\n\nTherefore, both processes involve chemical changes, making option C the correct answer.",

In this case, Jason's room is described as \"tidy\" while it is actually described as \"overgrown,\" indicating that the room is untidy or messy. This creates a contrast between the literal meaning of the word \"tidy\" and its intended meaning, which is ironic.\n",
    "7777": "The answer is B. Amy learned to speak two languages in school. This option directly supports the conclusion that Amy acquired the ability to speak two languages as it indicates an educational or learning process where she developed her linguistic skills. \n\nOption A does not provide any evidence for Amy acquiring the trait; it only states a fact about her mother\u2019s language proficiency without any connection to Amy\u2019s own language abilities.\n",
    "7787": "The answer is C. \n\nThis option suggests that both Jayce's biological parents have wavy hair, which implies that they could pass on the gene responsible for wavy hair to their offspring. This is a strong indication that Jayce inherited the wavy hair trait from his parents. \n\nOption A does not provide enough information to conclude that Jayce inherited the trait, as it only mentions that Jayce's mother has long hair and Jayce has long hair. It doesn't specify whether or not the hair is wavy. Option B indicates that Jayce uses a headband to keep his wavy hair out of his face, but this does not provide any information about where he got the trait from. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.\n",

    "7811": "The answer is A.\n\nFirst, a layer of sand was deposited. Later, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited.\n\nThe text states that a fast-flowing river deposited heavy sediment grains along its banks, while light sediment such as mud was carried away by the strong water current. This indicates that initially, there was a layer of sand deposited by the river. Over time, the river dried up, and the area became a desert. In the desert, sediment was deposited by wind, resulting in a layer of sand and pebbles being deposited later on. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n",

The other options are not directly related to the results of Isabella's test.\n",
    "7858": "The answer is B. It makes its own food.\n\nIn a food chain, producers are organisms that can make their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Producers are typically plants or algae, as they use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which provides them with energy. In this case, the diatom is a type of algae, so it can make its own food through photosynthesis. The other organisms in the food chain, such as the midge larva and brown trout, are consumers, meaning they obtain their energy by eating other organisms.\n",
    "7864": "The answer is B. The sentence uses a metaphor to compare Mrs. Snyder to an owl, indicating that she shares similar characteristics with an owl, such as being active at night and resting during the day. A metaphor directly compares two things by stating one thing is another, while a simile compares two things using \"like\" or \"as.\" In this case, the sentence does not use \"like\" or \"as,\" so it is a metaphor.\n",

This will allow her to determine if there is a significant difference in the bounce height between the two surfaces. \n\nOption A is not possible because Florence does not have access to different sizes of basketballs. Option B is also not feasible since she doesn't have access to a dirt path. Therefore, option C is the most suitable choice given the available resources.\n",
    "8488": "The answer is C. Richmond.\n",
    "8493": "The answer is A. \n\nExplanation: The statement \"Akira has dark skin\" indicates that Akira possesses the trait of dark skin. To determine if this trait was inherited, we need to consider the genetic basis of skin color. Skin color is influenced by multiple genes, but one of the key genes involved in determining skin pigmentation is the MC1R gene. This gene has been shown to be associated with variations in skin color, including darker skin tones.\n\nIf Akira's parents also have dark skin, it suggests that they may share the same variant of the MC1R gene or other genes related to skin pigmentation. This shared genetic background increases the likelihood that Akira inherited the trait of dark skin from her parents. Therefore, option A provides evidence supporting the conclusion that Akira inherited the trait of dark skin from her parents.\n",

    "9015": "The answer is B.\n",
    "9016": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- A copper statue turning green involves the formation of copper carbonate, a chemical reaction that occurs due to exposure to moisture and carbon dioxide in the air. This is a chemical change because new substances are formed.\n- Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is also a chemical process. The polish contains chemicals that react with the tarnish (a layer of silver sulfide) to convert it back into metallic silver, effectively removing the tarnish. This is another example of a chemical change.\n\nBoth processes involve chemical reactions, making option B the correct choice. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they describe either heating, cooling, or physical changes, respectively, which do not apply to the given scenarios.",

    "9122": "The answer is B. California is farthest south among the given options.\n",
    "9123": "The answer is A. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: An old sandwich rotting in a trashcan involves the breakdown of organic matter through bacterial and fungal action, which is a chemical process. Similarly, using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon involves the chemical reaction between the tarnish (a compound of silver and sulfur) and the polishing agent, which helps to dissolve or react away the tarnish. Both processes involve changes at the molecular level, making them chemical changes rather than physical ones. Heating and cooling can cause physical changes but not necessarily chemical changes; therefore, options C and D are incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because while some physical changes may occur during the processes, the primary changes described are chemical reactions.\n",
    "9124": "The answer is A. Sample B has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample A. Since the average particle speed is the same in both samples, the higher mass particles in Sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy, which is directly related to temperature. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.\n",

In this case, we want to give the smoke detector human-like qualities by using an action that a person would perform. Option B, \"went off,\" is the most appropriate choice because it implies that the smoke detector activated itself in response to a fire alarm, as if it were a person who noticed something was wrong and took action. Option A, \"awoke,\" does not fit well here since a smoke detector cannot be asleep or wake up like a person would. Therefore, option B is the correct answer for completing the sentence using personification.\n",

Since \"mat\" comes before \"movies\" in alphabetical order, any word that falls between these two words would be placed on the same page as \"movies.\" Therefore, \"minute\" would be found on the same page as \"movies,\" while \"mustard\" would be found on a different page because it comes after \"movies.\"\n",
    "10400": "The answer is B. The supply of cough drops will probably go down because the factories that produce them were destroyed by floods, which means there will be fewer facilities available to manufacture the cough drops. This reduction in production capacity will likely lead to a decrease in the overall supply of cough drops in the market.",
    "10403": "The answer is C. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and gravel and tearing a piece of paper are both examples of physical changes because they involve altering the form or state of matter without changing its fundamental composition. Mixing sand and gravel does not create new substances; it simply combines different materials together. Similarly, tearing a piece of paper does not change the chemical properties of the paper; it merely alters its shape and size. Neither process involves the creation or destruction of molecules, so they are classified as physical changes rather than chemical ones.",

    "10425": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, a smaller distance results in a stronger magnetic force. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n",
    "10435": "The answer is B. The hotter brownie has more thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object possesses. Higher temperatures indicate that there is more kinetic energy in the particles making up the object, resulting in increased thermal energy.

    "11712": "The answer is C. Maryland.\n",
    "11713": "The answer is A. 3 kilometers. \n\nThis is because hiking trails are typically measured in kilometers, as they represent distances that people walk or hike. Centimeters, millimeters, and meters are too small to accurately measure the length of a hiking trail, as they would be more appropriate for measuring smaller objects or distances. Therefore, option A is the most accurate estimate for the length of a hiking trail.\n",
    "11716": "The answer is B. Ambystoma texanum.\n\nExplanation: The axolotl belongs to the genus Ambystoma. Therefore, any organism that shares the same genus must be in the same family. Option A, Taricha torosa, belongs to the genus Taricha, while option C, Lissotriton helveticus, belongs to the genus Lissotriton. Only option B, Ambystoma texanum, belongs to the same genus as the axolotl.\n",
    "11720": "The answer is B.\n\nThe magnets will attract each other because opposite poles attract. In the image, one magnet has its south pole facing the north pole of the other magnet, and vice versa. This means that the south pole of one magnet is facing the north pole of the other magnet, which will cause them to attract each other.\n",
    "11731": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine which mountain biker was moving at a higher speed, we need to calculate their speeds using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor both mountain bikers, the time taken is 5 hours.\n\nFor option A:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_A = \\frac{105 \\text{ kilometers}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 21 \\text{ kilometers per hour} \\]\n\nFor option B:\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_B = \\frac{135 \\text{ kilometers}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 27 \\text{ kilometers per hour} \\]\n\nComparing the two speeds:\n- Speed of mountain biker A: 21 kilometers per hour\n- Speed of mountain biker B: 27 kilometers per hour\n\nSince 27 kilometers per hour is greater than 21 kilometers per hour, the mountain biker in option B was moving at a higher speed.\n",
    "11742": "The answer is A. The sentence \"The word exoskeleton means 'outside skeleton'\" is a fact because it provides an accurate definition of the term \"exoskeleton\". On the other hand, the sentence \"Creatures with exoskeletons, such as crabs, look scary\" is an opinion or statement of personal preference, as it expresses a subjective view that may not be universally agreed upon.",

They indicate the first and last words on that page. If the guide words are \"gear\" and \"gnat,\" any word between these two letters will be found on that page. Therefore, among the options provided, \"gasoline\" falls within the range of letters between \"gear\" and \"gnat,\" making it the correct choice.",
    "11760": "The answer is A. The description of the red salamanders matches all the traits listed for amphibians: they spend part of their lives in water and part on land, have moist skin, and lay eggs with no shells. The baby red salamanders living underwater further supports the fact that they spend part of their lives in water. On the other hand, great blue herons are birds and do not possess any of the amphibian traits mentioned in the context.\n",
    "11767": "The answer is A. With the given supplies, Austin can investigate whether watercolor paintings dry faster when they are placed inside (in the dining room) compared to being placed outside (on the picnic table in the backyard). This experiment would allow him to compare the drying times under different environmental conditions, specifically focusing on indoor versus outdoor placement. \n\nOption B cannot be investigated because there is no fan available among the supplies. Option C cannot be investigated as well since there is only one size of watercolor painting available, so it is not possible to compare the drying times between a large and a small painting.",
    "11774": "The answer is A.\n",
    "11779": "The answer is B. Ad Hominem: An attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person instead of addressing the actual argument or issue being discussed. In this case, the statement \"How could Hazel have anything insightful to say about foreign affairs? She grew up on a farm\" is an ad hominem fallacy because it attacks Hazel's background rather than addressing her qualifications or knowledge regarding foreign affairs.",
    "11786": "The answer is D. 17 millimeters. \n\nCaterpillars can vary in size depending on their species, but they typically range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in length. Therefore, option D (17 millimeters) is the most reasonable estimate among the given options.",

    "11848": "The answer is A. Thresher sharks have fins, not limbs, they hatch from eggs with no shells, and they can use their tail to hit and stun their prey. These characteristics align with the traits of fish as described in the context. On the other hand, Amazon milk frogs have moist skin, live in South American rain forests, and hatch from eggs with no shells but do not have fins or limbs, making them not fit the fish traits mentioned in the context.\n",
    "11851": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to use a word that gives life-like qualities to the tomatoes, making them seem as if they are proud or showing off their abundance. \"Boasted of\" is a more fitting choice because it implies that the tomatoes are expressing pride in their bountiful nature, which is a human-like quality. \n\nSo, the completed sentence would be: \"At the farmer's market, bright red tomatoes boasted of a bountiful harvest.\"\n",
    "11863": "The answer is B. \n\nText message B is more formal because it uses proper capitalization, punctuation, and includes the title \"Ms.\" before the name, which adds a level of formality to the message.

This weakness became known as Achilles' heel, symbolizing a vulnerability or weakness that can be exploited.",
    "12006": "The answer is C. transparent.\n\nAll four objects - window, glass, icicle, and ceramic tea cup - are transparent to varying degrees. This means that light can pass through them without being blocked or scattered significantly. While the window may have some degree of opacity due to its structure, it still allows light to pass through it. The glass and icicle are completely transparent, allowing light to pass through them unobstructed. The ceramic tea cup, while not completely transparent, has a thin layer of glass on the inside that allows light to pass through it. Therefore, all four objects share the property of transparency.\n",

    "12022": "The answer is A. European robin.\n\nEuropean robins have a conical beak that is well-suited for catching insects, as it allows them to easily pick up and consume small prey items like insects, worms, and spiders. This adaptation helps them to efficiently forage for food in their natural habitat, which often includes areas with dense vegetation where insects are abundant. In contrast, the rosy-faced lovebird has a shorter, more curved beak that is better suited for eating seeds and fruits, so its beak is not adapted to catch insects.\n",
    "12025": "The answer is C. \n\nChristina can investigate whether small rocks or large rocks skip more times when thrown across the river using the available supplies. She has access to both small and large flat rocks, so she can compare their skipping abilities. However, she does not have any round rocks, so she cannot investigate the difference between round and flat rocks. Additionally, she does not have enough information to determine if the river or a pond would make a difference in the skipping ability of the rocks, as she only has access to the river by her school. Therefore, option C is the most suitable question for her to investigate with the given supplies.\n",
    "12027": "The answer is B. The cup of black tea with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. When an object has more thermal energy, it means that its particles are moving faster and have higher kinetic energy, resulting in a higher temperature. Conversely, when an object has less thermal energy, its particles move slower and have lower kinetic energy, leading to a lower temperature. Therefore, the cup of black tea with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature compared to the other cup.",

    "12092": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is important to use proper capitalization and punctuation. Therefore, option A, \"Dear Uncle Brian,\" is the correct choice because it includes both a capital letter for the greeting and the appropriate comma after the salutation. Option B, \"dear Uncle Brian,\" lacks the capitalization and comma, making it incorrect in terms of formal letter writing etiquette.\n",
    "12095": "The answer is B. Rr.\n\nThis means that Peaches has the genotype \"Rr\" for the cheek color gene, where \"R\" represents the allele for bright orange cheeks and \"r\" represents the allele for pale orange cheeks. Since Peaches has one allele for bright orange cheeks (R) and one allele for pale orange cheeks (r), her genotype is heterozygous (Rr). This indicates that she has both the bright orange and pale orange cheek traits in her genetic makeup, but since the allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant, her phenotype will be bright orange cheeks.\n",

    "12114": "The answer is B. \n\nThe statement \"Max's mother has blue eyes. She passed this trait down to Max\" provides evidence that Max inherited the blue eye trait from his mother. This is because traits are passed down through genes from parents to offspring, and in this case, the mother's blue eyes suggest she carries the gene responsible for blue eyes, which she likely passed on to her child, Max. Option A does not provide genetic or familial information, so it cannot support the conclusion that Max inherited the blue eye trait.",
    "12118": "The answer is B. Snowy owls have sharp, curved beaks and live in cold places. They have feathers on their feet to protect them from the cold. Mother owls keep their eggs warm by standing on their shells. This description matches all the bird traits mentioned: they have feathers, wings, a beak, and lay eggs with shells. \n\nOption A describes black howler monkeys, which do not have feathers, wings, or lay eggs with shells, so they do not fit the criteria for being classified as birds.\n",

It is composed of various minerals, including biotite, feldspar, and quartz, which can be seen as distinct grains within the rock. The presence of these mineral grains indicates that granodiorite is an intrusive igneous rock, meaning it formed deep within the Earth's crust as magma cooled slowly over time. Metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, form from the transformation of pre-existing rocks under high pressure and temperature conditions, while sedimentary rocks are formed by the accumulation and cementation of sediments. Therefore, based on its formation process, granodiorite is classified as an igneous rock.\n",
    "12164": "The answer is A. If Trevor decides to join the Photography Club, spending more time in the Photography Club than he would have spent in the Theater Club would be considered a cost because it means he is giving up time that could have been spent elsewhere, such as with friends, studying, or pursuing other interests. This trade-off between time spent in the Photography Club versus other activities is a cost associated with his decision to join the Photography Club.\n",
    "12168": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases, the magnets in Pair 2 will experience a stronger magnetic force compared to the magnets in Pair 1.\n",
    "12173": "The answer is A. A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change because it involves a chemical reaction where the banana undergoes oxidation, causing the color to change from yellow to brown.

Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, since the average kinetic energies of the particles in both samples are equal, they also have the same temperature.\n",
    "12352": "The answer is B. Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific location, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. On the other hand, climate describes the long-term patterns of weather in a particular area, including average temperatures, rainfall, and other factors that occur over an extended period. Since the statement \"It has not rained in over a week at Trevor's house\" is describing a current event, it is referring to the weather rather than the climate.",
    "12356": "The answer is A. \n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are facing opposite poles towards each other (N-S), while in Pair 2, they are facing the same poles towards each other (S-N). Since opposite poles attract and like poles repel, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be attractive, while the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be repulsive. However, since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same (3.2 cm), the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both cases. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n",

    "12957": "The answer is A. \n\nA sentence fragment is a group of words that expresses an incomplete thought or does not contain a subject and a predicate. Option A, \"A cheese sandwich with lettuce and tomato,\" is a sentence fragment because it lacks a subject and a predicate. It describes a cheese sandwich but does not provide any action or statement to complete the thought. On the other hand, option B, \"The girls climb on the bars at the playground,\" is a complete sentence because it contains both a subject (\"the girls\") and a predicate (\"climb on the bars at the playground\").\n",
    "12959": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, so the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nIn this case, Sample A has particles with a mass of 32 u and an average speed of 1,100 m/s, while Sample B has particles with a mass of 16 u and an average speed of 910 m/s. Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, but their average speeds are also greater, it is difficult to determine which sample has the higher average kinetic energy without more information.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, we can infer that Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy because its particles have a greater mass and a higher average speed compared to those in Sample B. Therefore, Sample A has the higher temperature.\n",

    "13827": "The answer is A. \n\nExplanation: Photosynthesis is the process by which organisms convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose or other organic compounds. It primarily occurs in plants, algae, and certain bacteria. In option A, it is mentioned that painted nettles combine water and carbon dioxide to make sugars inside their cells, which is a key step in the process of photosynthesis. This indicates that painted nettles are capable of performing photosynthesis. On the other hand, option B describes planthoppers as insects that obtain sugars by consuming nectar from plants, which is a form of heterotrophy rather than photosynthesis. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the correct choice is A.",
    "13830": "The answer is C. Duck C moved the greatest distance in the same amount of time, indicating it had the highest speed among the three ducks. \n\nTo calculate the speed of each duck, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor Duck A:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{400 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 40 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nFor Duck B:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{545 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 54.5 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nFor Duck C:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{660 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 66 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nDuck C had the highest speed with 66 miles per hour compared to Duck A's 40 miles per hour and Duck B's 54.5 miles per hour.",
    "13835": "The answer is A. Ovis canadensis.\n\nExplanation: The Dall sheep belongs to the genus Ovis, so we need to find another organism that also belongs to the same genus.

    "13864": "The answer is A.\n",
    "13870": "The answer is A. 3:1\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are FF, Ff, Ff, and Ff. Since the allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f), all of these combinations will result in offspring with sour fruit. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with sour fruit to offspring with sweet fruit is 4:0 or 100% sour fruit. This corresponds to option B.\n",
    "13873": "The answer is B. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to give the wind human-like qualities. Option A, \"rushed by,\" implies the wind is moving quickly past Reid, but it doesn't convey any human-like emotion or characteristic. Option B, \"sang in,\" gives the wind a human-like quality by suggesting it is singing, which is an emotional and expressive action. Therefore, option B is the correct choice to complete the sentence using personification.\n",
    "13881": "The answer is D. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: When a banana gets ripe, it undergoes a process called ethylene-induced ripening, where the fruit releases ethylene gas that triggers biochemical reactions within the fruit, leading to changes in its color, texture, and flavor. This process involves the breakdown of starch into sugars, which causes the banana to become sweeter and softer. Similarly, milk going sour is due to a chemical reaction between lactic acid bacteria and the milk proteins, resulting in the production of lactic acid. This process causes the milk to change its taste and texture, making it sour. Both of these processes involve chemical changes rather than physical changes or heating.",
    "13893": "The answer is B. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases, cells using oxygen to break down sugar and burning food on a stove involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds between molecules. This process is known as a chemical reaction, where new substances are formed from the original reactants. In the case of cells using oxygen to break down sugar, the sugar molecule is broken down into simpler molecules like carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the process. Similarly, when food is burned on a stove, the chemical bonds within the food molecules are broken, releasing heat and producing new substances such as smoke and ash. Therefore, both processes are examples of chemical changes.\n",
    "13898": "The answer is C. a new plant.\n\nDouglas fir seeds grow inside of cones, and when they germinate, they can grow into a new plant. The other options, a female cone or a male cone, are not correct because these are parts of the tree that produce the seeds, not the seeds themselves.\n",

    "13936": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the flower form trait in the offspring: Ff, ff, Ff, and ff. Out of these four combinations, only one combination (ff) results in single flowers. Therefore, the probability that a rose plant produced by this cross will have single flowers is 1 out of 4, or 1/4.\n",
    "13938": "The answer is B.\n",
    "13940": "The answer is A.\n\nExplanation: The slump test is a method used to determine the consistency of freshly mixed concrete. It measures the ability of the concrete to maintain its shape after being poured. By performing the slump test, Ann and Kiara can assess whether a new batch of concrete is firm enough to use for their construction project. If the concrete collapses when the cone is lifted, it indicates that the batch is too wet and not firm enough, and should not be used. On the other hand, if the concrete stays in a cone shape, it means that the batch is firm enough to be used. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n",

    "14596": "The answer is A. \n\nPersonification is a literary device where human characteristics or emotions are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, we want to complete the sentence with an attribute that gives life-like qualities to time. Option A, \"creeps up on you,\" is a personification because it attributes the human action of creeping to time itself. This makes sense in the context of the sentence as it implies that time is passing by stealthily, something that humans can relate to.\n\nOption B, \"affects everyone,\" is more of a general statement rather than a personification. It does not give time any specific human-like quality but instead describes its impact on people in a straightforward manner.\n",

Hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence.\n\nIn this case, the person making the statement is drawing a conclusion about all cyclists based on a single incident they experienced with one cyclist. This is an example of a hasty generalization because it is making a broad claim about a large group of people based on limited evidence.\n",
    "15521": "The answer is B. \"A snooty person\" has a more negative connotation compared to \"a proud person.\" While both phrases describe someone with a certain attitude or demeanor, \"snooty\" implies arrogance, superiority, or an air of disdain, which are generally considered undesirable traits. On the other hand, \"proud\" can be seen as a positive attribute, indicating self-confidence or achievement. However, it's important to note that context and individual interpretation can influence the perception of these terms.\n",
    "15526": "The answer is A. Hammerkop.\n\nHammerkop birds are known to be excellent waders, as they spend most of their time foraging in shallow waters. Their long legs allow them to wade through the water easily while searching for food such as fish, amphibians, and insects. This adaptation helps them to efficiently hunt and catch their prey in aquatic environments. In contrast, the white tern is a seabird that primarily feeds on fish and squid, and it does not have the same need for wading as the great egret or the hammerkop.\n",
    "15529": "The answer is C. Mackenzie can investigate whether milk chocolate or dark chocolate melts faster when heated on the stove using the available supplies. She can set up an experiment where she heats both types of chocolate bars on the stove and measures the time it takes for each type to melt. This will allow her to determine if there is a difference in melting rates between the two types of chocolate. \n\nShe cannot investigate option A because she does not have access to a microwave. Option B is incorrect because she does not have any white chocolate available to compare with the dark chocolate.",

    "15615": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option indicates that Christina's parents have red hair, suggesting that they likely passed the trait of having red hair to Christina through genetic inheritance. The fact that her mother wears her hair in braids does not provide evidence of genetic inheritance; it only describes an aspect of how she styles her hair. Therefore, option B is the correct choice as it directly relates to the genetic inheritance of the trait.\n",
    "15616": "The answer is A. 11 gallons. \n\nThis is because a car's gas tank typically holds a large amount of fuel, usually measured in gallons. 11 gallons would be a reasonable estimate for the capacity of a standard car's gas tank. Fluid ounces and cups are smaller units of measurement that would not accurately represent the volume of a car's gas tank.\n",
    "15622": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample B. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in mass between the particles in each sample will affect their average kinetic energy. The average kinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Therefore, since the particles in Sample A have a greater mass, they will have a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature compared to the particles in Sample B.\n",

    "15664": "The answer is A. The text uses verbal irony, where the speaker says something that is opposite to their actual meaning or intention. In this case, the speaker is saying that Danny's room is tidy, but it is actually described as being messy like an overgrown garden, which implies that the room is untidy. This is an example of verbal irony because the speaker is using a statement that contradicts the actual state of affairs to convey a different message or emotion.\n",
    "15677": "The answer is B. The idiom \"Speak of the devil!\" is often used to express that someone is being mentioned right after they appear or enter the scene. In this case, Becky says it because she was talking about Dirk before he entered the room, and now he is there. This suggests that Becky had just been speaking about Dirk.\n",
    "15688": "The answer is A. Lissotriton helveticus.\n\nExplanation: The smooth newt's scientific name is Lissotriton vulgaris. The genus of an organism is the first part of its scientific name, so the genus of the smooth newt is Lissotriton. Therefore, any other organism that shares the same genus must also be in the same genus. Option A, Lissotriton helveticus, is in the same genus as the smooth newt because it also begins with \"Lissotriton.\" Options B and C are not in the same genus as the smooth newt because they begin with different genus names.\n",
    "15695": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"moan\" would not be found between the guide words \"mask\" and \"meek\" because it does not start with the letter \"m\". Guide words in dictionaries are used to help locate specific words alphabetically, and they indicate the range of words that can be found on a particular page.

    "15798": "The answer is B. The cookie with less thermal energy has a lower temperature. \n\nThermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. When an object has more thermal energy, it means that its particles are moving faster and have higher kinetic energy, resulting in a higher temperature. Conversely, an object with less thermal energy has slower-moving particles and lower kinetic energy, leading to a lower temperature. Therefore, the cookie with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature compared to the other cookie.",
    "15801": "The answer is C. Guilt by association is a logical fallacy where a person or idea is discredited because they are associated with something or someone else that is considered undesirable or wrong. In this case, the argument is that since no one is born writing plays like Shakespeare did, he must have had formal schooling. This is an attempt to discredit the idea that Shakespeare could have learned to write plays without formal schooling by associating it with the notion that only those who have formal education can write plays.",

    "15878": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nThis is because Rick's naturally straight hair is likely due to his genetic makeup, which is passed down from his parents. Since the trait is present in him, it can be inferred that he inherited it from one or both of his parents who also have naturally straight hair. This is an example of a genetically determined trait, as opposed to an acquired trait, which would be something that develops over time through experiences or environmental factors.\n",
    "15884": "The answer is B. Joel's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes. This suggests that Joel inherited the trait of having hazel eyes from his father, as the trait is likely to be passed down through genetic inheritance. The other options do not provide evidence of genetic inheritance or direct connection to Joel's eyesight.\n",
    "15892": "The answer is B. 325 milliliters. \n\nThis is because a standard can of soda pop typically holds around 325 milliliters of liquid.

It has a light brown or tan color that helps it camouflage itself among the sand dunes and rocks. This adaptation allows the Namaqua chameleon to avoid predators and hunt more effectively by blending in with its surroundings. On the other hand, the polar bear is adapted to the cold Arctic environment and is not typically found in sandy deserts.\n",
    "15973": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and water and melting wax both involve changes in the state or form of matter without altering its fundamental composition. In the case of mixing sand and water, the sand particles remain intact but are dispersed throughout the water, forming a suspension. Similarly, when wax melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid state due to an increase in temperature, but the wax molecules themselves do not undergo any chemical transformation. Therefore, both processes are classified as physical changes rather than chemical ones.",

    "16153": "The answer is D.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the leaf type trait: LL, Li, Li, and ll. Since the allele for regular leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for potato leaves (l), any tomato plant with at least one L allele will have regular leaves. Therefore, the probability that a tomato plant produced by this cross will have regular leaves is 3 out of 4, or 3/4.\n",
    "16155": "The answer is B.\n",
    "16165": "The answer is B. To move the wagon at the same speed each time, Chase needs to pull with a larger force on the friend who weighs more. Since a friend weighing 23 pounds is heavier than one weighing 21 pounds, Chase would need to exert more force to pull the heavier friend at the same speed as pulling the lighter friend. This is because the force required to overcome friction and move an object is proportional to its weight. Therefore, the friend who weighs 23 pounds requires a greater force to be pulled at the same speed compared to the friend who weighs 21 pounds.",

    "16700": "The answer is A.\n\nMutualistic relationships are those where both organisms benefit from the interaction. In this case, the bullhorn acacia tree benefits because the ants protect its leaves from being eaten by insects and other animals, while the ants benefit because they get food (nectar) from the tree. Therefore, the relationship between the acacia ants and the bullhorn acacia tree is mutualistic.\n",
    "16701": "The answer is B. Paving a street is considered a good because it provides a physical product that can be owned and used by individuals or entities. It is an infrastructure improvement that enhances the functionality and accessibility of the street, making it easier for people to travel and for businesses to operate.

This literary reference is an example of an allusion to literature.\n",
    "16819": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. According to the inverse square law, the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Therefore, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is larger, the magnetic force between them will be weaker compared to the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2, where the distance is smaller.\n",

Therefore, an estimate of 41 minutes would be a reasonable choice for the baking time of lasagna.",
    "16875": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample B. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the particles in Sample A will have more kinetic energy due to their larger mass. As temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, Sample A will have a higher temperature compared to Sample B.\n",
    "16882": "The answer is B. Inherited.\n\nRebecca's naturally blond hair is an example of a trait that is inherited. This means it is passed down from her parents through their genes. Hair color is determined by genetic factors, so if Rebecca has naturally blond hair, it indicates that she inherited the gene responsible for blond hair from one or both of her parents. The fact that she can dye her hair does not change the fact that her hair color is determined by her genetic makeup, making it an inherited trait rather than an acquired one.\n",

    "16921": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n\nIn Pair 1, the magnets are aligned with their opposite poles facing each other (N-S and S-N). This means that they will attract each other, creating a magnetic force. However, in Pair 2, the magnets are aligned with their like poles facing each other (N-N and S-S). This means that they will repel each other, creating a stronger magnetic force compared to Pair 1 where the attraction is weaker due to the opposite poles facing each other. Therefore, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n",

This statement is an exaggeration meant to convey the idea that his parents would be very upset or angry if they found out about something personal.",
    "17927": "The answer is A.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 36 u and the average particle speed is 1200 m/s. In Sample B, the mass of each particle is 32 u and the average particle speed is also 1200 m/s. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in their average kinetic energies is due to the difference in the masses of the particles. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\nKE = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the average kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the average particle speed. Since the average particle speed is the same in both samples, the difference in the average kinetic energies is due to the difference in the masses of the particles. Therefore, Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy than Sample B because its particles have a greater mass.\n\nSince temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas, Sample A has a higher temperature than Sample B.\n",
    "17932": "The answer is B. The hotter glass of milk has more thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object contains. Higher temperatures indicate that there is more kinetic energy in the particles within the substance, resulting in more thermal energy overall. Since the hotter glass of milk has higher temperature compared to the colder one, it contains more thermal energy.\n",
    "17935": "The answer is C. Hazel can investigate whether a catapult with a longer arm launches a rubber ball farther than one with a shorter arm using her available supplies. She can compare the distance traveled by the rubber ball when launched from each of the two catapults with different arm lengths. This will help her determine if there is a relationship between the length of the catapult arm and the distance the ball travels. \n\nTo conduct the experiment, Hazel should set up both catapults side by side, ensuring they are at the same height and angle. She should then launch the rubber ball from each catapult and measure the distance it travels. By comparing the distances, Hazel can draw conclusions about the effect of the arm length on the distance the ball travels.\n",

    "17942": "The answer is A. The bath towel with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. When an object has less thermal energy, it means that its particles have less kinetic energy, resulting in a lower temperature compared to an object with more thermal energy. Therefore, the bath towel with less thermal energy will be cooler than the one with more thermal energy.",
    "17945": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.\n\nThis is because the magnets in Pair 2 are smaller than those in Pair 1, and the strength of the magnetic force depends on the size and shape of the magnets. Smaller magnets generally have less magnetic force compared to larger ones, so the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker than that in Pair 1.\n",

Option A only indicates an interest in insects but does not provide evidence of Ava acquiring the specific trait of being able to identify them.",
    "18709": "The answer is C. Both are caused by heating.\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, heat is involved as a driving force for the change. \n\n- Burning a marshmallow over a campfire involves the marshmallow being exposed to an open flame, which provides the necessary heat to cause the marshmallow to melt and become charred.\n- An engine using gasoline to power a car also relies on heat generated through combustion. When gasoline is ignited inside the engine cylinders, it releases energy that powers the vehicle. This process is fundamentally based on the principle of heat transfer and chemical reactions that occur due to the application of heat.\n\nIn both cases, the primary mechanism for the change is the application of heat, making option C the correct choice.",

    "18715": "The answer is B. If Ernest decides to join the Theater Club, giving up the opportunity to be in the Photography Club would be considered a cost because it means he won't get to experience the fun that comes with being part of the Photography Club. This option highlights the trade-off between joining one club over another, where the cost is the enjoyment and experiences missed out on by choosing the Theater Club instead of the Photography Club.\n",
    "18721": "The answer is B. Mineral.\n\nGraphite is a mineral because it is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and crystalline structure. It is composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, giving it its characteristic dark gray color and fixed crystal structure. While graphite can be found in nature, it is not made by living organisms, making it a mineral rather than a rock.",
    "18732": "The answer is A. Sea otter.",
    "18744": "The answer is C. The statement \"Eli's friend taught him how to fly a kite\" provides evidence that Eli acquired the ability to fly a kite through learning from another person, which supports the conclusion that he has this trait. Options A and B do not directly indicate that Eli learned the skill from someone else; they only mention that Eli enjoys flying a kite or that his neighbor helped repair one, but these do not necessarily imply that Eli learned how to fly a kite himself.\n",
    "18748": "The answer is C. Solution A.\n\nIn Solution A, there are more green particles (solute) in relation to the solvent volume compared to Solution B. Since the concentration of a solution is determined by the ratio of solute to solvent, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.\n",
    "18750": "The answer is A. The word \"hole\" would be found between the guide words \"habit\" and \"hinge\" in a dictionary because it comes alphabetically after \"habit\" and before \"hinge.\"",
    "18754": "The answer is C. Isabella has green eyes like her biological mother. This indicates that she likely inherited the green eye trait from her mother, as traits are typically passed down through genetic material from parents to offspring. The other options do not provide evidence of inheritance but rather describe behaviors or physical characteristics that may or may not be related to genetics.\n",

    "18758": "The answer is C. Roger can trade his tomatoes for Sebastian's broccoli.\n\nBased on the information provided, Roger wants tomatoes and broccoli while Sebastian wants tomatoes and almonds. Since both Roger and Sebastian want tomatoes, they can trade their tomatoes with each other to get what they want. Therefore, Roger can trade his tomatoes for Sebastian's broccoli.\n",
    "18766": "The answer is B. \n\nOption A contains a dependent clause (\"but we can make it into bread crumbs for the meatballs\") that makes it a complex sentence. Option B is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause (\"He showed the officers a hotel receipt and an airplane ticket as proof of his time in Buenos Aires\").",
    "18768": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence refers to the Trojan Horse from Greek mythology, where the Greeks hid soldiers inside a large wooden horse to trick the Trojans into bringing it into their city, leading to their downfall.",

    "18800": "The answer is A. The genotype for the leaf texture gene in this summer squash plant is Ll, as it has one allele for fuzzy leaves (L) and one allele for smooth leaves (l).",
    "18810": "The answer is B. With the given supplies, Roger can investigate whether squirrels prefer sunflower seeds or walnuts by setting up two identical feeders, one containing sunflower seeds and the other containing walnuts. By observing and recording how many times each feeder is visited and how much food is taken from each feeder, Roger can determine if there is a preference between the two types of seeds. This experiment allows him to test the hypothesis that squirrels might have a preference for one type of seed over the other based on their nutritional value, taste, or availability.\n",
    "18820": "The answer is C. Olympia.\n",
    "18821": "The answer is A. The euphemism \"big-boned\" suggests that Hunter is overweight, as it is commonly used to describe someone who is heavier or larger in size due to excess body fat rather than just having larger bones.",
    "18825": "The answer is C. 20 cups. \n\nWatering cans typically hold between 1 to 2 gallons of water, which is equivalent to approximately 4 to 8 liters or 16 to 32 cups. Therefore, option C (20 cups) would be the most accurate estimate for the volume of a standard watering can. Option A (20 fluid ounces) is too small, as it is only about one-fifth of a gallon, while option B (20 gallons) is too large, as it is more than double the typical capacity of a watering can.",
    "18826": "The answer is A - acquired.\n\nMost scars are caused by accidents during a person's life, so Lee's scar on his left ankle is most likely an acquired trait due to an accident or injury that occurred in his life. It is not typically something that is inherited from parents or family members.\n",
    "18827": "The answer is B. Boston.\n",
    "18830": "The answer is A. Hyperbole is used in this text. The statement \"like fetching coffee, take him years to finish\" is an exaggeration, as it is highly unlikely that fetching coffee would take someone years to complete. This is an example of hyperbole, where the speaker uses an extreme or exaggerated statement to make a point or emphasize a particular idea.",
    "18832": "The answer is A. Sandy's phenotype for the body color trait is a golden body because she has the homozygous genotype \"bb\" for the body color gene, where the allele for a golden body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). Since Sandy has two recessive alleles, her phenotype will be the recessive trait, which in this case is a golden body.",

    "18851": "The answer is C. The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.\n\nExplanation: Since all the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic properties are similar. The distance between the magnets in each pair is also the same (40 mm). Therefore, the strength of the magnetic force between the magnets should be the same in both pairs.\n",
    "18855": "The answer is A.\n",
    "18862": "The answer is B. A long-distance running race typically refers to a marathon, which is 26.2 miles in length. Therefore, option B (12 miles) is a better estimate compared to option A (12 feet), as it more accurately represents the distance of a long-distance running race.\n",
    "18863": "The answer is C. Springfield.\n",
    "18866": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2.

    "18940": "The answer is C. Concord.\n",
    "18947": "The answer is C. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: Cooking an egg involves a chemical change where the proteins in the egg white denature due to heat, causing them to coagulate and form a solid structure. An antacid tablet reacting with water also represents a chemical change as it involves the reaction between the active ingredient in the antacid (usually aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide) and the acid in the stomach, producing new substances like water and carbon dioxide. Neither of these processes can be described as purely physical changes since they involve the formation of new substances through chemical reactions.",
    "18951": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond. This means that the forces acting on Desmond are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net force of zero. Since the net force is zero, Desmond remains stationary or moves at a constant velocity, as per Newton's first law of motion. In this case, the forces of gravity pulling downwards and the diving board pushing upwards are equal, causing no acceleration and maintaining Desmond's position on the diving board.",
    "18952": "The answer is B. The statement \"Paul was not born knowing how to identify different fish. He had to learn this skill\" supports the conclusion that Paul acquired the trait of being good at identifying fish. This implies that the ability to identify fish is something that Paul developed through experience or learning rather than being an innate characteristic he was born with. Option A does not provide any evidence of Paul acquiring the trait; it only states that he has pet fish, which could be related but doesn't directly indicate how he learned to identify fish.\n",

    "18974": "The answer is D. 157 years.\n\nTo find the time that passed between these two events, we need to subtract the year of the Constitutional Convention from the year the Civil War began:\n\n1861 - 1787 = 74 years\n\nHowever, since the Civil War began in 1861, we need to add one more year to account for the fact that the Civil War started in 1861, not in 1860. Therefore, the total time that passed between the Constitutional Convention and the start of the Civil War is 74 + 1 = 75 years.\n\nSince none of the given options match 75 years, it seems there might be an error in the provided options or the timeline. Please double-check the information and options for accuracy.\n",
    "18982": "The answer is D. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation: Mixing sand and water and a rock heating up in a campfire both represent physical changes. Mixing sand and water does not create new substances or alter the fundamental properties of the materials involved; it merely combines them into a different form. Similarly, heating a rock in a campfire causes the rock to change temperature but does not alter its chemical composition or produce any new substances. These processes are purely physical transformations without the creation or destruction of matter, making them physical changes rather than chemical ones.",
    "18986": "The answer is B. The metaphor suggests that despite the negative situation of losing his job, there was still an opportunity or positive aspect (pursuing a new career) that provided hope and direction for Connor. This implies that even in times of adversity, there can be benefits or opportunities that arise.\n",
    "18989": "The answer is B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Francesca.\n\nTo explain further, in physics, a net force is the sum of all the forces acting on an object. If the net force is zero, then the forces are said to be balanced, meaning that the object will remain at rest or continue moving at a constant velocity. In this case, the force of gravity pulling Francesca down is 600N, and the force of the seat pushing her up is 1,200N. Since these two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. Therefore, the forces on Francesca are balanced, and there is no net force acting on her. This means that she will continue to move at a constant velocity along the path of the roller coaster, assuming that all other forces on her are also balanced.\n",

    "19701": "The answer is B. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use a comma after the salutation. Therefore, option B, \"Dear Fred,\" is the correct choice. Option A, \"dear Fred,\" omits the comma, which is considered incorrect in standard English grammar for formal correspondence.\n",
    "19704": "The answer is A. rock.\n\nCalcarenite is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate, usually in the form of small fragments of shells, coral, or other organic remains. It is not a single mineral but rather a mixture of various minerals and organic materials that have been compacted and cemented together over time. Therefore, it is classified as a rock rather than a mineral.\n",
    "19721": "The answer is B. Styrofoam packing peanuts are generally considered to be more difficult to break or crush compared to a glass flask. While both materials can be broken under enough force, the structure and composition of styrofoam make it more resistant to impact than glass. Additionally, styrofoam is lightweight and can be easily compressed, whereas glass flasks are heavier and more rigid. However, it is important to note that both materials should be handled with care to avoid injury or damage.\n",
    "19722": "The answer is A.\n\nThe Great Victoria Desert is a desert ecosystem in southern Australia. Deserts are characterized by their arid climate, which means that they receive very little rainfall. This lack of water can make it difficult for plants to grow, so deserts often have dry, thin soil. Additionally, because there is less water available, there are typically fewer types of organisms living in a desert ecosystem compared to other types of ecosystems. Therefore, option A better describes the Great Victoria Desert ecosystem.\n",

    "19763": "The answer is A. armadillo lizard.\n\nThe image shows an armadillo lizard, which has a hard scale covering much of its skin. This adaptation allows it to protect itself from predators with sharp teeth by rolling into a ball and covering its soft parts. The European robin, on the other hand, does not have such a protective adaptation and would be more vulnerable to predators with sharp teeth.\n",
    "19780": "The answer is A. An ice skate is typically much shorter than 29 kilometers, so option A (29 centimeters) would be a more accurate estimate.\n",
    "19785": "The answer is B. The allusion to Pinocchio's nose growing suggests that Patty might be lying or exaggerating her story about loading the dishwasher before watching Dancing with the Stars. This is because in the classic fairy tale, Pinocchio's nose grows longer whenever he tells a lie. By comparing Patty's mother's response to this well-known story, it implies that Patty may not be telling the truth about her actions.\n",
    "19803": "The answer is C.\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles are equally likely. Since the allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m), any goat with at least one M allele will have myotonia congenita. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita is 3:1.\n",
    "19804": "The answer is A. In option A, \"nauseous\" is used in its traditional sense to describe an unpleasant smell, while in option B, it is used to describe Shannon's reaction to the smell, which is more aligned with the modern usage of the word.",

    "19826": "The answer is A. Teaching art can be considered both a good and a service, but it is generally categorized as a service in economic terms. As a service, it provides value to students by helping them develop their artistic skills, creativity, and critical thinking abilities. Additionally, teaching art can contribute to the cultural and educational development of a community. However, it is also considered a good because it can provide personal satisfaction and fulfillment to those who teach art, as well as financial benefits to those who offer it as a profession. Ultimately, whether teaching art is classified as a good or a service depends on the perspective and context in which it is viewed.\n",
    "19829": "The answer is B.\n\nIn option B, \"he\" refers to Tyler, but \"it\" could refer to either trigonometry or calculus, making the pronoun reference vague. Option A clearly states that Tyler did not comprehend calculus, so there is no ambiguity in the pronoun reference.\n",

    "19859": "The answer is A. The word \"begin\" would not be found between the guide words \"balance\" and \"blew\" because it does not fall within that alphabetical range. Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the first and last words on a page. If a word is not between these guide words, it means the word is either before or after them alphabetically. Since \"begin\" comes after \"blew,\" it would be found on a page with guide words like \"blew\" and \"began\" or later in the dictionary.",
    "19862": "The answer is A. Hyperbole is used in this text. The statement \"like fetching coffee, take him years to finish\" is an exaggeration, as it is highly unlikely that fetching coffee would take someone years to complete.

    "19871": "The answer is B. Caribou has thick fur that helps it stay warm in cold environments like the Arctic tundra where the Arctic fox lives. The fire salamander, on the other hand, is an amphibian that lives in moist environments and does not have fur or adaptations for cold weather.\n",
    "19873": "The answer is D. Albany.\n",
    "19890": "The answer is B. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker compared to the force between the magnets in Pair 2.\n",
    "19891": "The answer is B. The euphemism \"golden years\" typically refers to the later stages of life, often associated with retirement and relaxation. This suggests that Mr. Duran is old, as he is enjoying his retirement in a luxurious setting close to his grandchildren.\n",
    "19901": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of the particles. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in temperature will be determined by the difference in the masses of the particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the mass of each particle is 4 u, while in Sample B, the mass of each particle is 17 u. Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, the particles in Sample B have more kinetic energy per unit mass compared to those in Sample A. Therefore, Sample B has a higher temperature.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) sample B.\n",
    "19902": "The answer is A.\n\nThe magnets will attract each other because they are placed with their opposite poles facing each other. Opposite poles attract each other, so the north pole of one magnet will be attracted to the south pole of the other magnet. This causes the magnets to pull together and attract each other.\n",
    "19906": "The answer is B. New York City.\n",
    "19915": "The answer is B. Perfume typically contains fragrances that are designed to be strong and noticeable, making it the option that would likely smell the most among the three choices provided. Icicles and metal paper clips generally do not have scents associated with them, so they would not smell as strongly as the perfume.",
    "19918": "The answer is A. Both are chemical changes.\n\nExplanation: \n- An antacid tablet reacting with water involves a chemical reaction between the antacid (which typically contains aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide) and the water to form new substances like aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide.\n- Acid rain weathering a marble statue involves a chemical reaction between the acid rain (which contains sulfuric or nitric acid) and the calcium carbonate in the marble, leading to the formation of calcium sulfate and other compounds that cause the marble to deteriorate.\n\nBoth processes involve the formation of new substances as a result of chemical reactions, making them chemical changes rather than physical changes. Heating and cooling can sometimes cause physical changes, but they are not relevant to the given examples. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",
    "19919": "The answer is A.\n",
    "19921": "The answer is C. It eats a primary consumer.\n\nIn the given food chain, the red fox is a tertiary consumer because it feeds on the deer mouse, which is a primary consumer. Primary consumers are organisms that feed directly on producers, such as plants or algae. In this case, the deer mouse is a primary consumer because it feeds on slender wheatgrass, which is a producer. The red fox, being a tertiary consumer, is at the top of the food chain and feeds on other animals, such as the deer mouse, which are primary consumers.",

    "19954": "The answer is A. Ethos (character).\n\nThe advertisement uses the ethos appeal by presenting the Ashton-Baker Credit Union as an institution that has been protecting people's money since 1902. This establishes the company's credibility and trustworthiness, which is important for financial institutions. By emphasizing their long history of protecting customers' money, the ad aims to build confidence in the credit union and encourage potential customers to choose them for their financial needs.\n",
    "19958": "The answer is E. 2:2\n\nExplanation: The Punnett square shows that all four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are Ee. This means that all of the offspring will have one dominant allele (E) and one recessive allele (e). Since the allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e), all of the offspring will have curled ears. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4 or 0:4.",

    "19982": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where Tessa is being discredited based on her friends' actions, rather than any evidence directly linking her to starting the food fight. This is an attempt to discredit her character by associating her with her friends' behavior, which is not necessarily indicative of her own actions or intentions.\n",
    "19983": "The answer is B.\n\nThe magnets will attract each other because they are opposite in polarity. The first magnet has an N pole facing the S pole of the second magnet, and the S pole of the first magnet faces the N pole of the second magnet. Since opposite poles attract, the magnets will pull together and attract each other.\n",
    "19992": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use a comma after the salutation. Therefore, option A, \"Dear Josie,\" is the correct choice. Option B, \"dear Josie,\" omits the comma, which is considered incorrect in standard English grammar.\n",

(C) Hinduism began about 500 years before Judaism.\nAnswer: The answer is B.\n\nContext: Read the text about okapis.\nWhen you first see an okapi, you might think it's related to a horse or a zebra. Its body and neck are horse-like, and its legs have black-and-white stripes like a zebra does. But the okapi is not related to a horse or a zebra; its closest relative is actually the giraffe. In fact, okapis are sometimes called forest giraffes, since they live mainly in the rain forests of central Africa.\nAn okapi's relationship to a giraffe is most noticeable in its face. Like giraffes, okapis have long, thin faces topped with large, upward-pointing ears. Male okapis also have little furry horns like giraffes' horns. Additionally, both giraffes and okapis have long, dark tongues, which can grab and strip leaves from trees. And just like giraffes, okapis are plant eaters, feeding on leaves, buds, twigs, and fruit.\nIn many ways, though, okapis are quite different from their giraffe cousins. An okapi's neck is much shorter than a giraffe's. This is useful, because a long neck would make it difficult to move through thick vegetation.",

    "20846": "The answer is C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.\n\nThis is because the size of the magnets affects their magnetic strength. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields than smaller ones. In Pair 1, the magnets are larger compared to those in Pair 2, so they will exert a greater magnetic force on each other. In contrast, the magnets in Pair 2 are smaller, resulting in a weaker magnetic force between them.\n",

    "20919": "The answer is C. Carson City.\n",
    "20943": "The answer is C. 6 pounds. \n\nThis is because guitars typically weigh around 6 pounds or less, depending on the size and material used in its construction. Tons and ounces are much larger units of measurement that would be more appropriate for estimating the mass of a heavy object like a truck or a large animal, rather than a small musical instrument like a guitar.",
    "20954": "The answer is A. New Zealand.\n",
    "20956": "The answer is A.\n\nThe bar chart shows the volume of fresh water withdrawn per year in the U.S., with data collected every five years from 1950 to 2005. The chart indicates that the volume of fresh water withdrawn per year increased steadily until 1980, after which it remained relatively stable. Therefore, option A is supported by the data.\n",

    "21010": "The answer is A. Briar's phenotype for the fur texture trait is straight fur because she has the homozygous genotype FF, which means she has two copies of the dominant allele F for straight fur. Since the allele for straight fur is dominant, Briar will express the straight fur phenotype.\n",
    "21013": "The answer is A. Brett's naturally black hair is an inherited trait because it is determined by genetic factors passed down from his parents. Hair color is influenced by multiple genes, and if Brett has naturally black hair, it suggests that he inherited the genes responsible for this trait from his parents. This is in contrast to acquired traits, which are developed through environmental factors or experiences during one's lifetime.",
    "21018": "The answer is B. There is no sentence fragment in the given text. Both sentences are complete thoughts with a subject, verb, and object, making them independent clauses that can stand alone as sentences.",
    "21021": "The answer is B. Snowy owl. \n\nSnowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia, where they inhabit tundra habitats. They have thick, fluffy feathers that provide excellent insulation against the cold temperatures and harsh winds of their environment. Their white plumage also helps them blend into the snowy landscape, making it easier for them to hunt for prey such as lemmings and hares. In contrast, Amazon milk frogs are found in tropical rainforests in South America, where they have smooth, moist skin that helps them stay hydrated in humid conditions. Therefore, the snowy owl's skin is adapted for survival in cold places, while the Amazon milk frog's skin is adapted for survival in warm, humid environments.\n",

    "21100": "The answer is B.\n",
    "21102": "The answer is A. A book is considered a good because it is a physical object that can be owned, sold, and exchanged like other tangible items. It provides value to its owner through the information and entertainment it offers, but it does not provide a service in the traditional sense of providing a benefit or action to another person. Services, on the other hand, are intangible actions or benefits provided by one party to another, such as a haircut, a meal, or a ride in a taxi.",
    "21103": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass than those in Sample B. Since both samples have the same average particle speed, the difference in mass between the particles in each sample will affect their average kinetic energy. The average kinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Therefore, since the particles in Sample A have a greater mass, they will have a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature compared to the particles in Sample B.\n",
    "21104": "The answer is B. 50\u00b0F. \n\nThis is because 50\u00b0F is a more accurate representation of the temperature of a cool glass of milk compared to 50\u00b0C. In Celsius, 50\u00b0C is equivalent to approximately 122\u00b0F, which would be too hot for a cool glass of milk. On the other hand, 50\u00b0F is closer to the typical temperature range for a cool glass of milk, which is usually around 40-50\u00b0F or 4-10\u00b0C. Therefore, option B is the better estimate for the temperature of a cool glass of milk.\n",
    "21109": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Nellie by associating her with her sister who only watches reality television, implying that Nellie must also be watching reality television as well. This is an attempt to discredit Nellie based on the actions of another person, rather than providing evidence or reasoning to support the claim about Nellie's viewing habits.\n",
    "21114": "The answer is A. Grizzly bears are at the top of the food chain in this food web, meaning they eat other animals such as caribou and lemmings. When these animals die, their bodies decompose and the nutrients in them are released back into the environment. Mushrooms are decomposers, meaning they break down dead organic matter and recycle it back into the ecosystem. Therefore, the matter from the grizzly bear's body will eventually move to the mushroom.\n",
    "21127": "The answer is B. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is the correct way to write the title of a movie, as it uses quotation marks around the title to indicate that it is a specific work, such as a book or film. Option A uses asterisks instead of quotation marks, which is not the standard format for movie titles.",
    "21151": "The answer is A. The words \"tin\" and \"win\" both end with the \"-in\" sound, so they rhyme with each other. However, \"fan\" ends with the \"-an\" sound, making it the word that does not rhyme with the other two options.\n",
    "21156": "The answer is B. 13 gallons. \n\nThis is because a typical car's gas tank holds around 12-16 gallons of gasoline, depending on the size and make of the vehicle. Therefore, option B, 13 gallons, is the most accurate estimate among the given options.",
    "21161": "The answer is A. The term \"draconian\" comes from the law code of Draco, an ancient Athenian statesman who lived around 621 BC. His laws were known for their harshness and severity, hence the term \"draconian\" to describe something that is extremely severe or harsh.",
    "21163": "The answer is C. An adult great white shark typically measures around 6 meters in length.\n",
    "21168": "The answer is B. Namaqua chameleon.\n\nThe Namaqua chameleon is known for its ability to blend into the sandy desert environment due to its coloration and shape. It has a light brown or tan color that helps it to camouflage itself among the sand dunes and rocks. This adaptation allows the Namaqua chameleon to avoid predators and hunt for food more effectively. On the other hand, the strawberry poison frog is native to tropical rainforests and does not have any adaptations for living in a sandy desert.\n",
    "21172": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Tim learned to speak two languages, which directly supports the conclusion that he acquired the ability to speak two languages as a result of learning it in school. Option A does not provide any evidence or context to support the conclusion that Tim acquired the trait of speaking two languages based on his mother's language skills alone.\n",
    "21174": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine which fish was moving at a lower speed, we need to calculate the speed of each fish using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor Fish A:\n- Distance = 20 kilometers\n- Time = 5 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed of Fish A} = \\frac{20 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 4 \\text{ km/hour} \\]\n\nFor Fish B:\n- Distance = 25 kilometers\n- Time = 5 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed of Fish B} = \\frac{25 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 5 \\text{ km/hour} \\]\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Fish A: 4 km/hour\n- Fish B: 5 km/hour\n\nFish A was moving at a lower speed than Fish B. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",

This will help him understand if there is a preference between the two types of food items.\n",
    "21183": "The answer is C. Europe.\n",
    "21198": "The answer is C. The sentence \"Give Daniel a tour of the building and then take him to Mr. Carlson's office\" is an imperative sentence because it gives a command or instruction to perform an action.",
    "21207": "The answer is B. \n\nInheritance of traits typically follows genetic patterns, where certain traits are passed down from parents to offspring through their genes. If Rick's biological father has curly hair, it suggests that Rick may have inherited the gene responsible for curly hair from him. This is because traits like hair texture can be influenced by genetic factors, and if one parent has a specific trait, there is a higher likelihood that their offspring will inherit that trait as well. However, it's important to note that other factors such as environmental influences or random genetic mutations can also play a role in determining hair texture. Therefore, while the presence of curly hair in Rick's father provides evidence that he might have inherited the trait, it does not definitively prove that he did so."
