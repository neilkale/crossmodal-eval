    "6": "The answer is A. The verbal irony suggests that the snoring is actually very loud, contrary to the statement that it is \"as quiet as a jackhammer.\"",
    "7": "The answer is B. armored catfish. \n\nThe armored catfish has a mouth that is adapted for bottom feeding, similar to the sturgeon. It has a wide, flat mouth that allows it to sift through the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean to find its food, which includes invertebrates, plants, and small fish. The mouth of the armored catfish is also located on the underside of its head and points downward, making it well-suited for bottom feeding.",
    "8": "The answer is A. \n\nThe given sentence is not a complete sentence because it lacks a subject and a verb. It starts with \"During the construction of Mount Rushmore,\" which is a prepositional phrase, and then continues with an incomplete thought. To make it a complete sentence, it would need to be structured as follows:\n\n\"During the construction of Mount Rushmore, approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock was removed from the mountain to create the monument.\"\n\nThis revised version includes both a subject (\"rock\") and a verb (\"was removed\"), making it a complete sentence.",
    "13": "The answer is C. Wendy's test could show whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin. By measuring the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria that received extra nutrients compared to the bacteria that did not receive extra nutrients, Wendy can determine if the additional nutrients had a positive effect on insulin production. This will allow her to assess whether she successfully increased the amount of insulin produced by the bacteria by 20%. Options A and B are not directly related to the specific goal of Wendy's experiment, which is to increase insulin production by 20%.",
    "14": "The answer is B. \"A Breath of Fresh Air\" is the correct title format for a play, as it follows standard capitalization rules for titles, with each significant word capitalized.",
    "16": "The answer is B.",
    "18": "The answer is B. Having horns. \n\nSince Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, she has two copies of the dominant allele H. According to the context provided, the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). Therefore, Daffodil will express the dominant trait, which is not having horns. However, since the question asks for her phenotype for the horns trait, and given that she has the genotype HH, it implies that she does have horns because the dominant allele H is present in both copies. Thus, the correct answer is (B) having horns.",
    "28": "The answer is B. New Zealand falcon. \n\nWhile both the bald eagle and the New Zealand falcon have strong, sharp talons that are adapted for grabbing and holding onto prey, the New Zealand falcon is known to be a skilled predator that hunts small birds, reptiles, and insects. Its feet are specifically adapted for grasping and manipulating its prey, making it an excellent hunter in its natural habitat. On the other hand, the sable is a type of weasel that primarily feeds on small rodents, insects, and birds. While it may have sharp claws, they are not as specialized or adapted for grabbing prey as those of the New Zealand falcon.",
    "36": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Mars using the given data:\n\n- Volume of Jupiter = 1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3\n- Volume of Mars = 1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times larger Jupiter's volume is compared to Mars' volume:\n\n(1.43 x 10^15 km\u00b3) / (1.63 x 10^11 km\u00b3) \u2248 8.79 x 10^3\n\nThis means that Jupiter's volume is approximately 8,790 times larger than Mars' volume. Since 8,790 is more than 10,000, the statement \"Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars\" is true.",
    "45": "The answer is D. Boston.",
    "50": "The answer is B. \n\nThe completed sentence would be: \"A light spattering of raindrops fell upon the stadium, kissing the fans' cheeks.\" This option uses personification by attributing human-like actions (kissing) to the raindrops.",
    "52": "The answer is C. Earthquakes start below Earth's surface. During an earthquake, the ground shakes.",
    "55": "The answer is A.",
    "60": "The answer is B. Cape vulture. \n\nCape vultures are known for their hooked beaks, which are specifically adapted to tear through meat. This adaptation allows them to efficiently consume carrion, which forms a significant part of their diet. Sand martins, on the other hand, have a different type of beak that is more suited for catching insects in flight, making option A incorrect.",
    "66": "The answer is B. Verbal irony is used in this text because the statement \"You're an energetic puppy!\" is said while observing an ancient pug that seems to sleep all day, which creates a contrast between the words spoken and the actual situation, indicating sarcasm or irony.",
    "67": "The answer is A. The allusion in the sentence \"the prodigal son returned home\" comes from the Bible, specifically from the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15:11-32.",
    "71": "The answer is B. \n\nA car's gas tank typically holds between 30 to 60 gallons of gasoline, which is equivalent to approximately 114 to 228 liters. Therefore, option B (40 liters) is a more reasonable estimate compared to option A (40 milliliters), as 40 milliliters is much smaller than the capacity of a car's gas tank.",
    "72": "The answer is B. Idaho is farthest north among the given options.",
    "74": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option provides specific evidence of how Austen acquired the ability to build a fire, indicating that she learned it at summer camp. This directly supports the conclusion that Austen has the trait of knowing how to build a fire. Option A, while related, does not provide direct evidence of how the trait was acquired; it only states that Austen can use the skill to cook food, which is an outcome of the trait rather than the acquisition process itself.",
    "77": "The answer is C. soft. All three objects can be described as soft: soccer shorts are made of fabric that is soft to the touch, jello is a soft gelatin dessert, and an apron is typically made of soft material like cotton or polyester.",
    "79": "The answer is B. Seeds can come in many shapes and colors.",
    "81": "The answer is B.",
    "82": "The answer is B.",
    "89": "The answer is B. 41\u00b0F, as it is more common to express temperatures in Fahrenheit during cold weather conditions, especially in regions where Fahrenheit is the standard unit of measurement. 41\u00b0C would be considered quite warm, while 41\u00b0F is closer to a typical cold temperature.",
    "101": "The answer is B. Sour. Both limes and dill pickles are known for their sour taste.",
    "106": "The answer is A. barren-ground caribou.\n\nIn the food web, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, with the arrow pointing towards the organism that consumes another organism. In this case, the barren-ground caribou is shown to be consumed by the grizzly bear, indicating that it is a consumer. The bear sedge, on the other hand, is a producer as it is not being consumed by any other organism in the food web.",
    "113": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\n- For option A: The ship moved 555 kilometers west in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 555 km / 10 hours = 55.5 km/h.\n- For option B: The ship moved 95 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 95 km / 10 hours = 9.5 km/h.\n- For option C: The ship moved 460 kilometers south in 10 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 460 km / 10 hours = 46 km/h.\n\nComparing these speeds:\n- Option A: 55.5 km/h\n- Option B: 9.5 km/h\n- Option C: 46 km/h\n\nThe ship with the lowest speed is the one in option B, which moved at 9.5 km/h.",
    "118": "The answer is B. Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is \"short fur.\" This is because she has one allele for short fur (F) and one allele for long fur (f), which results in her having short fur as the dominant trait.",
    "122": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence, while a dependent clause cannot. Therefore, this sentence is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses that are connected by a coordinating conjunction (\"so\"). Option A is a simple sentence because it only contains one independent clause.",
    "124": "The answer is C.",
    "127": "The answer is B. Since the shopper is lifting each bag at the same speed, the bag that holds more weight will require a larger force to lift it. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds of food would be lifted with a larger force compared to the bag holding 4 pounds of food.",
    "147": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Rosa's father has brown eyes, indicating that he likely passed the brown eye trait to Rosa through genetic inheritance. This is a common way in which traits are inherited from parents to offspring. Option A does not provide any direct evidence of genetic inheritance but rather a correlation between Rosa's hair and eye color, which is not necessarily indicative of the same genetic trait being inherited.",
    "148": "The answer is A.",
    "150": "The answer is B.",
    "153": "The answer is B. The text uses the logical fallacy of guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Richard by associating him with his uncle who was imprisoned for embezzlement, thereby attempting to undermine his credibility or suitability for the position of class treasurer.",
    "160": "The answer is B.",
    "164": "The answer is B. Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny involves a chemical reaction where the acid in the vinegar reacts with the copper oxide on the surface of the penny, converting it back to copper, thus removing the tarnish. This process changes the composition of the substance, making it a chemical change.",
    "165": "The answer is B.",
    "169": "The answer is A. \n\nThe word \"import\" would not be found between the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry\" because \"import\" starts with the letter \"i,\" but it is positioned alphabetically after \"industry.\" Guide words in dictionaries help readers locate specific words by indicating the range of letters that the word begins with. Since \"import\" does not start with an \"i\" or any letter within the range indicated by the guide words \"ill\" and \"industry,\" it would be placed elsewhere in the dictionary.",
    "173": "The answer is A. The allusion to \"Midas touch\" suggests that Tyler is successful at all that he does, implying that he has an innate ability to succeed without needing special experience or training. This phrase is often used to describe someone who can turn their hand to anything they try and achieve great success with minimal effort.",
    "178": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"According to many scholars, the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature,\" there is an independent clause (\"the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth began the romantic period in English literature\") and a dependent clause (\"According to many scholars\"). This makes it a complex sentence because it contains one main idea (the publication of Lyrical Ballads) and one subordinate idea (the source of that information).\n\nOption B is a compound sentence because it consists of two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"Although\" without any dependent clause.",
    "206": "The answer is B.",
    "213": "The answer is C. \"Made\" does not rhyme with \"slide\" or \"ride.\"",
    "221": "The answer is A. \n\nIn formal writing, such as letters, it is customary to use the full name with the title or honorific, followed by a comma. Therefore, \"Dear Grandpa Tim\" is the correct format. Using just \"grandpa Tim\" would be less formal and might be considered informal in a professional or formal context.",
    "227": "The answer is B. Alec learned how to knit in an after school program.

Since these forces are in opposite directions, they are not balanced. The difference between the upward force and the downward force (1,200N - 600N = 600N) represents the net force acting on Kylie, which means that she is experiencing an acceleration due to the unbalanced forces.",
    "662": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.\n\nThis can be inferred from the fact that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than the distance between the magnets in Pair 2.

Therefore, based on the given descriptions, the blue-footed boobies are the animals that have all the bird traits listed above.",
    "818": "The answer is C. \n\nThe information in option C supports the conclusion that Pablo acquired the scar because it provides a specific cause for the scar, indicating that it was due to an accident where he cut his leg while falling off his skateboard. This suggests that the scar is a result of an event rather than being a genetic or familial trait. Options A and B do not provide a clear cause for the scar and instead suggest that the scar might be inherited or shared among family members, which does not support the conclusion that Pablo acquired the scar through an accident.",
    "821": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, the phrase \"Down, down, down!\" is repeated twice, making it an example of repetition. Option B does not contain any repeated phrases or words.",
    "825": "The answer is C: decreased.\n\nAs the water balloon falls towards Paul, its height relative to the ground decreases. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential energy) of the system remains constant if no external non-conservative forces act upon it. Since the mass of the water balloon did not change, the decrease in its gravitational potential energy must be balanced by an increase in its kinetic energy. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreases as the water balloon falls.",
    "829": "The answer is A. There is white ash on the ground.",
    "837": "The answer is A. The passage describes the weather because it refers to a specific observation made by Manuel about the sky being filled with cumulus clouds every day last week.

In Pair 2, the magnets are also facing opposite poles to each other (S-N), so they will also attract each other. However, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be stronger. This is because the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets. Therefore, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.",
    "3417": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature of a gas, we can use the relationship between the average kinetic energy of its particles and the temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is the average speed of the particle.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (1,600 m/s). However, the masses of the particles are different:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 16 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 32 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the particles, we can compare the kinetic energies as follows:\n\nFor Sample A:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nNotice that the speed term is the same for both samples, so the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than in Sample A, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is higher.\n\nThe temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Therefore, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature. Thus, Sample B has the higher temperature.",

Since Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll, the dominant allele (L) will express itself, resulting in a black coat.",
    "3453": "The answer is C. Sample B has the higher temperature because the average kinetic energy of its particles is greater than that of Sample A. Since both samples have the same number of particles with the same mass, the difference in their average particle speeds directly correlates to the difference in their average kinetic energies. The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature of the sample. Therefore, Sample B, with an average particle speed of 800 m/s, has a higher temperature compared to Sample A, with an average particle speed of 620 m/s.",

    "7158": "The answer is A.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Kinetic energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, as it is the energy associated with the motion of its particles.\n\nIn Sample A, the average particle speed is 600 m/s, while in Sample B, the average particle speed is 540 m/s. Since the mass of each particle in both samples is the same (32 u), the difference in their average particle speeds will result in a difference in their average kinetic energies.\n\nUsing the formula for kinetic energy, KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is the velocity, we can calculate the average kinetic energies for each sample:\n\nFor Sample A:\nKE_A = 0.5 * 32 u * (600 m/s)^2 = 576,000 u * m^2/s^2\n\nFor Sample B:\nKE_B = 0.5 * 32 u * (540 m/s)^2 = 486,000 u * m^2/s^2\n\nComparing the two values, we see that KE_A > KE_B, meaning that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B. Since the average kinetic energy is directly proportional to the temperature, Sample A has a higher temperature than Sample B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) sample A.",

    "9835": "The answer is A. The cherry pie with more thermal energy has a higher temperature. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; the greater the amount of thermal energy in an object, the higher its temperature. Since both pies are identical except for their thermal energies, the one with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature.",
    "9838": "The answer is D. Trinidad and Tobago. \n\nThe map highlights the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, located in the southern Caribbean Sea. It consists of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago, as well as several smaller islands and islets.",
    "9851": "The answer is A. \n\nSince \"game\" is the first word in the given guide words and \"gnaw\" is the second, any word that comes between these two would be placed alphabetically in between them. Therefore, \"gym\" would not be found on a dictionary page with those guide words.",
    "9853": "The answer is D. The highlighted ocean in the image is the Pacific Ocean.",
    "9854": "The answer is A. Both are only physical changes.\n\nIn the case of butter melting on a hot day, the change is from solid to liquid without altering the chemical composition of the butter. This is a physical change because no new substances are formed.\n\nSimilarly, peeling a banana involves removing the outer skin of the fruit, which is also a physical change as it does not alter the chemical structure of the banana itself. The peel is simply removed, leaving the fruit intact inside.",
    "9856": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 because the magnets in Pair 2 are larger than the magnets in Pair 1. Larger magnets generally have a stronger magnetic field, resulting in a greater magnetic force between them compared to smaller magnets with the same shape and material.",

    "9875": "The answer is A. \n\nIn option A, \"The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch,\" there is only one independent clause and no dependent clauses or conjunctions that would make it a complex sentence. Therefore, it is a simple sentence.\n\nOption B, \"Unless the weather forecast is wrong, you'll probably need an umbrella tomorrow,\" contains a dependent clause (\"Unless the weather forecast is wrong\") and an independent clause (\"you'll probably need an umbrella tomorrow\"), making it a complex sentence.",
    "9880": "The answer is B. 33 kilograms. \n\nThis is because a goat typically weighs much more than 33 grams. Goats can range in weight from around 20 to 100 kilograms or more depending on their breed and age. Therefore, 33 kilograms is a more reasonable estimate for the mass of a goat compared to 33 grams.",
    "9895": "The answer is B. Both are caused by heating. \n\nIn both cases, heat is used to cook or bake the food items:\n- Cooking an egg involves heating it to cook the egg white and yolk.\n- Baking an apple pie involves heating the oven to bake the pie crust and filling until they reach the desired doneness.",
    "9910": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and their size and shape. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume that they have the same magnetic strength. Therefore, the only factor that affects the magnetic force is the distance between the magnets. In both pairs, the distance between the magnets is the same, so the magnitude of the magnetic force should be the same in both pairs.",
    "9911": "The answer is B. Salem.",
    "9912": "The answer is C. 4,250 miles. \n\nThe Nile River is approximately 4,160 miles (6,690 kilometers) in length, making it the longest river in the world. The other options provided are much shorter distances, which would not accurately represent the length of the Nile River.",

The verbal irony suggests that despite saying it is the \"best day of his life,\" Mr. Garrison's tone (\"mumbled\") and the fact that his car broke down on the way to an important job interview imply that he is actually having a bad day.",
    "9919": "The answer is B. Atlanta.",
    "9922": "The answer is B. \n\nSince \"gallop\" is the first word in the given range of guide words and \"glad\" is the second, any word that comes after \"gallop\" and before \"glad\" would be placed between these two words in alphabetical order.

    "9927": "The answer is B. With the given supplies, Ariel can investigate whether a cell phone charges faster with a two-foot-long charging cable or a five-foot-long charging cable. This is because she has one cell phone, a stopwatch, and both lengths of charging cables, allowing her to measure the charging time with each cable type. \n\nShe cannot investigate options A or C because:\n- Option A requires turning the cell phone on and off, which is not possible with just the supplies provided.\n- Option C would require a computer, which is not included in the list of supplies.",
    "9930": "The answer is B. metal. \n\nThe image depicts a shield with a metallic appearance, featuring a silver or gray color and a reflective surface. This suggests that the shield is likely made of metal, such as steel or iron, which were commonly used in medieval times to create shields due to their durability and strength. Ceramic shields would typically be lighter and less durable, making them less suitable for use in combat situations.",
    "9938": "The answer is B. The text uses an oxymoron, where \"genuine imitation\" is a contradictory phrase. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two seemingly contradictory or opposite terms.

    "9956": "The answer is A. Raleigh.",
    "9964": "The answer is C. The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.\n\nThis can be inferred because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance between the magnets in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between the magnets, the magnets in Pair 2 will experience a stronger magnetic force compared to the magnets in Pair 1.",
    "9965": "The answer is A. \n\nBased on the image, the De Biesbosch National Park appears to be a wetland ecosystem, which means it has land that is covered with water during most of the year. Additionally, there are other water ecosystems visible in the background, such as lakes or rivers, indicating that the park has other water ecosystems nearby. Therefore, option A better describes the De Biesbosch National Park ecosystem. Option B does not accurately describe the park because it mentions \"poor in nutrients\" soil, which is not evident from the image.",
    "9968": "The answer is B. \n\nIn this context, both options describe bowls of oatmeal but with different temperatures. Since thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, the bowl of oatmeal at 80\u00b0F will have more thermal energy than the one at 70\u00b0F. This is because higher temperatures correspond to greater kinetic energy in the molecules of the substance, resulting in more overall thermal energy.",
    "9971": "The answer is B. 26 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a paintbrush is typically a small object used for painting, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than millimeters, kilometers, or meters. 26 centimeters is a reasonable length for a paintbrush, as it is shorter than most adult hands but still long enough to reach various parts of a canvas or paper.",
    "9972": "The answer is C. Patrick can trade his tomatoes for Isabelle's broccoli.",
    "9978": "The answer is B. Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it contains more green particles relative to its solvent volume compared to Solution B. Solution A has five green particles in a 25 mL solvent volume, while Solution B has four green particles in a 25 mL solvent volume. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of solute particles.",
    "9980": "The answer is B. The word \"border\" would not be found between the guide words \"bandage\" and \"breeze\" because \"border\" comes after \"breeze\" in alphabetical order. Guide words help readers locate specific entries in a dictionary by indicating the range of words that appear on each page. If a word starts with a letter that falls between the guide words, it will be found on the page where those guide words appear. Since \"border\" starts with 'b' and \"breeze\" also starts with 'b', but \"breeze\" comes first alphabetically, \"border\" would be found on a different page.",
    "9981": "The answer is E. \n\nIn the Punnett square, all four boxes contain the genotype \"Bb\". Since the allele for green body feathers (B) is dominant over the allele for blue body feathers (b), all the offspring will have green body feathers. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to offspring with green body feathers is 0:4 or 0:1. However, since there are no blue body feathers in the Punnett square, the closest option would be 0:4.",

None of the options (yellow or rough) apply to all three objects.",
    "10045": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Drivers should stop talking on their phones, or they should pull over,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction \"or.\" This makes it a compound sentence. Option A is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause.",
    "10048": "The answer is C. The sentence \"Mr. Brady will mail those letters\" uses the future tense because it includes the verb \"will mail,\" which indicates an action that is scheduled or expected to happen in the future.",
    "10051": "The answer is C. Compound-Complex.\n\nThis sentence is considered compound-complex because it contains both a compound sentence (two independent clauses joined by \"and\") and a complex sentence (a main clause with an embedded clause). The main clause is \"Elena is a competitive horseback rider,\" and the embedded clause is \"she will be competing in the next World Equestrian Games, which are held every four years.\"",
    "10055": "The answer is A. Cape vulture. \n\nCape vultures are birds that are adapted for flight, as they have wings and are capable of soaring through the air using their strong wings and keen eyesight to locate food sources. They are often seen gliding on thermals or using updrafts to stay aloft for long periods of time. On the other hand, the gaur is a large wild boar found in South and Southeast Asia, and it is not adapted for flight. Instead, it is adapted for running and swimming, as well as for digging and foraging for food.",
    "10059": "The answer is B.",
    "10060": "The answer is A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie. This is because the force of gravity (600N) acting downward is less than the force of the seat pushing up (1,200N).

    "10152": "The answer is A.",
    "10153": "The answer is B. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or opposite terms, such as \"jumbo shrimp\" or \"soft iron.\" In this case, \"something for everyone\" and \"target market\" are not contradictory terms, so this does not fit the definition of an oxymoron. Instead, the phrase \"something for everyone\" is more likely to be considered a general statement or a marketing slogan, while \"target market\" refers to a specific demographic being aimed at by the business. Therefore, neither option A (euphemism) nor option B (oxymoron) fits the context of the text provided.",
    "10156": "The answer is A. \n\nSince \"stork\" falls between the guide words \"shy\" and \"single,\" it would not be found on a dictionary page with those specific guide words.

As a member of the animal kingdom, humpback whales are heterotrophs, meaning they cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis or other means. Instead, they must consume other organisms to obtain the energy and nutrients they need to survive. Humpback whales primarily feed on small fish and krill, which they catch by filtering water through their baleen plates.",
    "10227": "The answer is B. The statement \"Neil, you didn't vote in the last election, so you clearly have no regard for the democracy in which we live\" uses a false dichotomy. This fallacy presents only two choices as if they are the only possibilities, implying that because Neil did not vote, he must have no regard for democracy. It overlooks other possible reasons why someone might not have voted, such as being unable to vote due to a disability, not being registered, or simply choosing not to participate in that particular election.",

    "10382": "The answer is A. Arctic wolf. \n\nArctic wolves are well-adapted to living in cold, snowy environments due to their thick fur coat that helps them stay warm and insulated during harsh winter conditions. Their white fur coloration provides excellent camouflage against the snow-covered landscape, making it easier for them to blend into their surroundings and avoid detection by both prey and predators. This adaptation is crucial for their survival in the Arctic tundra ecosystem where food resources can be scarce and competition for resources is intense.",
    "10383": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Neptune and Earth. According to the table, Neptune's volume is 62,530 billion km\u00b3, while Earth's volume is 1,090 billion km\u00b3. To find out how many times greater Neptune's volume is compared to Earth's, we can divide Neptune's volume by Earth's volume:\n\n62,530 / 1,090 = 57.48\n\nSince 57.48 is more than 50, the statement \"Neptune's volume is more than 50 times as great as that of Earth\" is true. Therefore, the answer is A.",

She can throw both small and large flat rocks across the river and count the number of skips each rock makes. This will allow her to compare the skipping behavior of small versus large rocks. \n\nShe cannot investigate options A or B because she does not have access to a pond or round rocks in her supplies.",
    "12027": "The answer is B. The cup of black tea with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature. This is because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the thermal energy, the higher the temperature. Therefore, if one cup has less thermal energy than the other, it must also have a lower temperature.",
    "12028": "The answer is C. The sentence \"Mr. Cho signed his name on the letter\" uses the past tense because it describes an action that was completed in the past.",
    "12030": "The answer is A. Having horns. \n\nSince Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh, she has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h). Because the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h), the presence of even one dominant allele will result in the dominant phenotype being expressed. Therefore, Zelda will have the phenotype of having horns.",

Therefore, the correct way to address someone in a letter would be \"Dear Uncle Brian,\" with the first word capitalized and the rest in lowercase letters. Option B is incorrect because it lacks the capitalization of the first word and the comma after \"Dear.\"",
    "12095": "The answer is B. Rr. \n\nThis means that Peaches has one allele for bright orange cheeks (R) and one allele for pale orange cheeks (r), resulting in a heterozygous genotype (Rr). Since the allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r), Peaches will exhibit the phenotype of having bright orange cheeks.",
    "12099": "The answer is B. 16 centimeters. \n\nThis is because a pen is typically a small object used for writing, and its length would be measured in centimeters rather than meters or kilometers. Millimeters would be too small to accurately describe the length of a pen, while meters and kilometers are much larger units that would be impractical for measuring something as small as a pen.",

    "14429": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Isaac couldn't find the definition for flax in the book's glossary, so he looked it up online,\" there are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"so.\" This makes it a compound sentence because each clause can stand alone as a complete thought. Option A is a simple sentence with only one independent clause.",
    "14432": "The answer is B. \n\nIn option B, \"Maria's bedroom is neat she puts everything away,\" there is a comma splice because the two independent clauses are joined by a comma without a coordinating conjunction. This creates a run-on sentence. Option A is correctly punctuated with a period between the two independent clauses, making it a proper sentence.",
    "14441": "The answer is B. Boise.",
    "14450": "The answer is B. \n\nSentence (B) \"Wheat is a kind of grass that is used to make food\" is a statement of fact because it provides an objective description of wheat without expressing an opinion or making a subjective judgment. Sentence (A), on the other hand, expresses an opinion about how much food made from wheat Americans should consume, making it a statement of opinion rather than a fact.",
    "14451": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature because it has particles with a higher average kinetic energy due to their greater mass and higher average speed compared to the particles in Sample B.

    "14460": "The answer is A. In an animal cell, the endoplasmic reticulum helps ribosomes build proteins. \n\nThis is because the endoplasmic reticulum in animal cells serves as a network of membranes that aids in the synthesis, modification, and transport of proteins. Ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis, attach to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they translate mRNA into proteins. This process is crucial for various cellular functions, including the production of enzymes, hormones, and other proteins necessary for cell survival and growth.\n\nOption B is incorrect because plant cells, not animal cells, use sunlight to make sugar through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is converted into chemical energy stored in glucose.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because plant cells typically contain both a nucleus and chloroplasts. While some plant cells may lack chloroplasts, such as those found in mature xylem or phloem tissues, most plant cells do possess these organelles. The nucleus is essential for storing genetic material and controlling cellular activities, while chloroplasts are responsible for carrying out photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy.",

They have a light-colored body that helps them blend into the sandy desert surroundings, making it difficult for predators to spot them. Additionally, they have a unique ability to change color, which can help them camouflage themselves further by blending in with their surroundings or signaling to other chameleons. This adaptation allows them to survive in the harsh desert conditions and avoid predation.",
    "15973": "The answer is B. Both are only physical changes.\n\nExplanation:\n- Mixing sand and water involves combining two substances without changing their fundamental properties or creating new substances. This is a physical change because no new substance is formed.\n- Melting wax also involves a change in state from solid to liquid, but it does not create a new substance. The wax molecules simply rearrange themselves into a different form, which is another example of a physical change.\n\nNeither of these processes involves a chemical reaction where new substances are created, nor do they involve cooling or heating as the primary cause of the change. Therefore, both mixing sand and water and melting wax are classified as physical changes.",

    "17926": "The answer is B. Hyperbole is used in this text because the statement \"My parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece\" is an exaggeration meant to emphasize the parents' reaction to hearing about personal matters. Hyperbole involves using extreme language to make a point or express strong emotion, which is evident here as a way to convey that the parents would be very upset.",
    "17927": "The answer is A. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass (36 u) compared to Sample B (32 u). Since both samples have the same average particle speed (1,200 m/s), the higher mass particles in Sample A will have a higher average kinetic energy. Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, so Sample A, with its higher average kinetic energy, has the higher temperature.",
    "17932": "The answer is B. The hotter glass of milk has more thermal energy because temperature is directly related to the amount of thermal energy an object contains. Higher temperature indicates that the particles in the substance are moving faster and thus have more kinetic energy, which translates to more thermal energy. Therefore, the hotter glass of milk will have more thermal energy compared to the colder one.",
    "17935": "The answer is C. Hazel can investigate whether a catapult with a longer arm launches a rubber ball farther than a catapult with a shorter arm using her available supplies.

    "17938": "The answer is D. Steve can trade his tomatoes for Hector's broccoli.",
    "17942": "The answer is A. The bath towel with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature. This is because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the thermal energy, the higher the temperature. Since both towels are identical in all other respects except for their thermal energy, the one with less thermal energy will be cooler or have a lower temperature compared to the one with more thermal energy.",
    "17945": "The answer is C. \n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 because the magnets in Pair 2 are smaller than the magnets in Pair 1. The strength of the magnetic force depends on the size and shape of the magnets, as well as the distance between them. Since the magnets in Pair 2 are smaller, they will have less magnetic force compared to the larger magnets in Pair 1. Additionally, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is the same as the distance between the magnets in Pair 1, the difference in the magnitude of the magnetic force is due to the size of the magnets themselves.",

    "19785": "The answer is B. The allusion to Pinocchio's nose growing suggests that Patty might be lying or exaggerating her claim about loading the dishwasher before watching the show. This is because in the story, Pinocchio's nose grows longer whenever he tells a lie, symbolizing dishonesty. Therefore, the mother's response implies that Patty may not be telling the truth about her actions.",

Icicles and metal paper clips generally do not have scents associated with them.",
    "19918": "The answer is A. Both are chemical changes.\n\nIn both cases:\n- An antacid tablet reacting with water involves a chemical reaction where the antacid neutralizes stomach acid, changing its composition.\n- Acid rain weathering a marble statue involves a chemical reaction between the acidic components of rainwater and the calcium carbonate in the marble, leading to the breakdown of the stone.\n\nThese processes involve the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, making them chemical changes rather than physical changes. Heating and cooling are not factors in either scenario; thus, options C and D can be eliminated. Option B is incorrect because the reactions described are not purely physical but involve chemical interactions.",
    "19919": "The answer is A. Yes, chrysotile is a mineral.

    "19932": "The answer is B. A house.",
    "19936": "The answer is B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Edna. This is because the force of gravity (600N) acting downward is less than the force of the seat pushing upward (1,200N). Since the forces are not equal in magnitude, they are unbalanced, resulting in a net force that causes Edna to accelerate downward along with the roller coaster cart.",

    "21080": "The answer is C. New Orleans.",
    "21082": "The answer is B. \n\nMarsh marigolds are plants, as they are flowering plants that produce seeds and grow above ground. They are known for their bright yellow flowers and are often found in marshy areas or near water bodies. On the other hand, sea otters are marine mammals that primarily feed on sea urchins, clams, and other marine organisms, so they are not plants.",
    "21091": "The answer is B. sweet. Both jello and grape juice can be sweet.",
    "21095": "The answer is B. Skeeter's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body.",
    "21098": "The answer is B. \n\nTo determine which goose was moving at a higher speed, we need to calculate the speed of each goose by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\nFor option A:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 640 miles / 10 hours\nSpeed = 64 miles per hour\n\nFor option B:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 290 miles / 10 hours\nSpeed = 29 miles per hour\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Goose in option A: 64 miles per hour\n- Goose in option B: 29 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the goose in option A was moving at a higher speed.",

    "21103": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a greater mass (40 u) compared to those in Sample B (20 u). Since both samples have the same average particle speed (1,000 m/s), the higher mass particles in Sample A will have a higher average kinetic energy. Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, so Sample A has a higher temperature than Sample B.",
    "21104": "The answer is (B) 50\u00b0F. \n\nIn Celsius, 50\u00b0C is equivalent to approximately 122\u00b0F, which is much warmer than a cool glass of milk. On the other hand, 50\u00b0F is closer to room temperature or slightly cooler, making it a more reasonable estimate for the temperature of a cool glass of milk.",
    "21109": "The answer is B. The statement \"Don't try to tell me that you only watch educational programming, Nellie! I know for a fact that your sister only watches reality television\" uses guilt by association.

Therefore, the matter from the lichen will eventually move to the grizzly bear, and then to the mushroom as the grizzly bear decomposes and returns nutrients to the soil.",
    "21127": "The answer is B. \n\nIn titles of movies, books, plays, songs, etc., it is common to use quotation marks around the title itself, while the name of the work (like the movie or book) is typically written in italics or bolded. Therefore, option B, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" with the title enclosed in quotation marks, is the correct format for the title of a movie. Option A uses asterisks instead of quotation marks, which is not the standard formatting for movie titles.",

    "21168": "The answer is B. Namaqua chameleon. \n\nNamaqua chameleons are native to the arid regions of southern Africa, including the Namib Desert, and are well-adapted to their environment. They have a unique ability to change color, which helps them blend into their surroundings and avoid predators. Additionally, they have a flattened body shape that allows them to move quickly across the sand, making them well-suited for life in the desert. While the flat-tail horned lizard is also adapted to be camouflaged in a sandy desert, the Namaqua chameleon is another example of an animal with similar adaptations.",
    "21172": "The answer is B. \n\nThis option suggests that Tim learned to speak two languages, which directly supports the conclusion that he acquired the ability to speak two languages as a result of learning it, possibly through schooling or other educational methods. Option A does not provide evidence for Tim acquiring the trait; it only states a fact about his mother's language use, which is unrelated to Tim's language skills.",
    "21174": "The answer is A. \n\nTo determine which fish was moving at a lower speed, we need to calculate the speed of each fish using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFor Fish A:\n- Distance = 20 kilometers\n- Time = 5 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed of Fish A} = \\frac{20 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 4 \\text{ km/hour} \\]\n\nFor Fish B:\n- Distance = 25 kilometers\n- Time = 5 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed of Fish B} = \\frac{25 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 5 \\text{ km/hour} \\]\n\nComparing the speeds:\n- Fish A: 4 km/hour\n- Fish B: 5 km/hour\n\nFish A was moving at a lower speed than Fish B.

    "21181": "The answer is A. With the given supplies, Garrett can set up an experiment to determine whether the squirrels prefer sunflower seeds or walnuts by placing both types of seeds in separate feeders and observing which one the squirrels collect more frequently. This will help him understand their food preferences based on the available options. \n\nFor option B, there is no tree mentioned in the supplies, so it cannot be investigated with the current setup. \n\nFor option C, while there are two feeders, there is no mention of different sizes, so it is not possible to test if the squirrels prefer one size over another.",

    "21207": "The answer is B. \n\nThis is because the presence of curly hair in Rick's biological father suggests that the trait could be passed down genetically from him to Rick. While option A indicates a correlation between Rick and another person with curly hair, it does not necessarily imply genetic inheritance. Option C mentions brown hair, which is unrelated to the curly hair trait being discussed. Therefore, option B provides the most direct evidence supporting the conclusion that Rick inherited the curly hair trait."
