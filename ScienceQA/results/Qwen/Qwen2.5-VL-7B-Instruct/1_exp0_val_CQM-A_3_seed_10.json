The average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Since both samples have the same average particle speed but different masses, we can calculate the average kinetic energy using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is the average speed of the particle.\n\nFor Sample A:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_A \\)) = 44 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_A \\)) = 1,100 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 44 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,100 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_B \\)) = 26 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_B \\)) = 1,100 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,100 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the sample with the greater mass will have a higher average kinetic energy.

    "8318": "The answer is C. Neither; the samples have the same temperature.\n\nExplanation: The average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas is directly related to the temperature of the gas. The formula that relates these quantities is:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of a particle and \\( v \\) is the average speed of the particles.\n\nIn both samples, the average particle speed (\\( v \\)) is the same (590 m/s). However, the masses of the particles are different:\n- Sample A: Mass of each particle = 34 u\n- Sample B: Mass of each particle = 28 u\n\nSince the average kinetic energy is given by the product of the mass and the square of the speed, we can compare the kinetic energies as follows:\n\nFor Sample A:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 34 \\, \\text{u} \\times (590 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 28 \\, \\text{u} \\times (590 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the speed \\( v \\) is the same for both samples, the kinetic energy will be proportional to the mass of the particles. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B because the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater.\n\nHowever, since the temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles, and the average kinetic energy is the same for both samples due to the equal speeds but different masses, the temperature must also be the same for both samples. This is because the temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy per particle, and the average kinetic energy per particle is the same in both cases despite the different masses of the particles.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (C) neither; the samples have the same temperature.",

The mass \\( m \\) of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, so the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher.

    "15622": "The answer is B. Sample A has the higher temperature. \n\nThis conclusion can be drawn based on the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and the temperature of the gas. The average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Since both samples have the same average particle speed (1,300 m/s), we need to compare the masses of the particles to determine which sample has the higher temperature.\n\n- Sample A has particles with a mass of 46 u.\n- Sample B has particles with a mass of 36 u.\n\nGiven that the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the sample with the heavier particles (Sample A) will have a higher average kinetic energy because the kinetic energy of a particle is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\). Since the speed \\( v \\) is the same for both samples, the mass \\( m \\) determines the kinetic energy. Therefore, Sample A, with the heavier particles, will have a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.",

The average kinetic energy of particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the substance. Since both samples have the same average particle speed (1,500 m/s), we need to consider the mass of the particles. The mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B (34 u vs. 20 u). Therefore, even though the average particle speed is the same, the higher mass in Sample A results in a higher average kinetic energy per particle compared to Sample B.

Sample A has the higher temperature. \n\nThis conclusion can be drawn based on the relationship between the average kinetic energy of gas particles and the temperature of the gas. The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Since both samples have the same average particle speed but different masses, we can calculate the average kinetic energy using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of a particle and \\( v \\) is the average speed of the particles.\n\nFor Sample A:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_A \\)) = 46 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_A \\)) = 1,600 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, A}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 46 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFor Sample B:\n- Mass of each particle (\\( m_B \\)) = 26 u\n- Average particle speed (\\( v_B \\)) = 1,600 m/s\n\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg, B}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,600 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 \\]\n\nSince the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the sample with the greater mass will have a higher average kinetic energy.

The mass \\( m \\) of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, so the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A is higher.

    "21103": "The answer is C. Sample A has the higher temperature. \n\nThis conclusion can be drawn based on the relationship between the average kinetic energy of the particles and the temperature of the gas. The average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Since both samples have the same average particle speed but different masses, we need to consider the mass as well. The formula for the kinetic energy of a particle is \\( \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is the velocity. Given that the average particle speed is the same for both samples, the sample with the heavier particles (Sample A) will have a higher average kinetic energy because the mass term \\( m \\) is larger. Therefore, Sample A has the higher temperature.",

The statement \"I know for a fact that your sister only watches reality television\" is an attempt to discredit Nellie by associating her with her sister's viewing habits, which are considered negative.",
    "21114": "The answer is A. Grizzly bears can consume lichen, which is shown in the food web as a food source for them. When the grizzly bear dies or is consumed by another organism, the matter in its body, including the lichen it ate, will eventually decompose and be broken down by decomposers like mushrooms. Therefore, the matter from the lichen that the grizzly bear consumed will move to the mushroom.",
