{"idx": 1, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/1.png", "answer": "(C)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled as \"C\". This can be inferred from its position relative to the others and the perspective of the photograph."}
{"idx": 2, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/2.png", "answer": "(C)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled as \"A.\" This is indicated by its proximity to the microphone and the fact that it is closer to the foreground of the image compared to the other points."}
{"idx": 3, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/3.png", "answer": "(B)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled as \"D.\" This is based on the perspective and depth of field, where \"D\" is positioned at the front of the tray and appears larger compared to the other items."}
{"idx": 4, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/4.png", "answer": "(B)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled with the letter \"D\". This is based on the perspective and depth of field in the photograph, where \"D\" is positioned in the foreground and appears larger relative to the other points."}
{"idx": 5, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/5.png", "answer": "(A)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled with the letter \"B\". This can be inferred from its position relative to the other points and the perspective of the photograph."}
{"idx": 6, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/6.png", "answer": "(D)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled as \"A.\" This is based on the perspective and depth of field in the photograph, where \"A\" is positioned at the front and lower part of the desk, closer to the viewer than the other points."}
{"idx": 7, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/7.png", "answer": "(D)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled as \"D.\" This can be inferred from its position relative to the foreground elements, such as the truck and the bench, which are closer to the viewer than the other points marked A, B, and C."}
{"idx": 8, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/8.png", "answer": "(B)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled as \"A\". This can be inferred from the perspective and the size of the water droplets, which appear larger and more detailed near the center of the image, suggesting they are closer to the camera lens."}
{"idx": 9, "prompt": "<IMAGE> Multiple points are circled on the image, labeled by letters beside each circle. Which point is the closest to the camera?", "image_path": "data/hardblink/images/blink4pointscenter/9.png", "answer": "(B)", "prediction": "The point that appears to be the closest to the camera in the image is labeled with the letter \"C\". This can be inferred from its position relative to the other points and the perspective of the photograph."}
