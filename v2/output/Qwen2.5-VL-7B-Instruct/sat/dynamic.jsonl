You are looking at the television from a certain angle, which appears to be slightly to the side rather than directly in front of it.\n\nGiven this information, if you were to look straight ahead, you would not be facing the television directly. Instead, you would be looking at something else that is not shown in the image, such as the wall or another object.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nb) no", "parsed_prediction": "B", "correct": false}
