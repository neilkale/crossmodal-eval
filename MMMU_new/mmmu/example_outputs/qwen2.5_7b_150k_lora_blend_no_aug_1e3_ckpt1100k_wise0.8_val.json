If individual #2 is not a carrier, then it follows that individual #1 must have received the non-disease allele from each parent. Consequently, individuals #3 and #4 are both heterozygous, as they must have received one normal and one disease allele.\n\nSince #5 is the offspring of two heterozygous carriers, there is a 25% chance that she is also a carrier. We can use this information to determine the probability of individual #7 being affected by the disease. Given that only the father contributes to an individual's phenotype under AR inheritance, we can only consider if #3 is a carrier, which has a probability of 0.25. The probability of #7 being affected is 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 or 12.5%.\n",
