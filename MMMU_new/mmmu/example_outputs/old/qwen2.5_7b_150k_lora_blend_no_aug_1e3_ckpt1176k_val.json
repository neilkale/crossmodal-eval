Therefore, there is a 50% chance that either #3 or #4 (or both) carries the disease allele.\n\nIf one of them, say #3, carries the disease allele, then the probability that #5 will inherit the allele is 50%. Similarly, the probability that #6 will inherit the allele is also 50%.\n\nSo, there's a 50% chance that #5 receives the allele from #3 and a 50% chance that #6 receives the allele from #4. This means that there is a 50% * 50% = 25% chance that both #5 and #6 inherit the disease allele.\n\nSince both parents are affected, there is a 100% chance that individual #7 will be affected by the disease.\n",

For this specific waveform, the period is 2 ms.\n\nThe given function is i(t) = 4 sin(\u03c0t/2 ms). The amplitude of this function is 4A.\n\nThe effective value, I_avg can be calculated as:\nI_avg = \u221a(1/T \u222b[0,T] i^2(t) dt)\n\nSubstituting i(t)= 4sin(\u03c0t/2 ms), the equation becomes:\nI_avg= \u221a(1/(2ms) \u222b[0,2ms] (4sin(\u03c0t/2 ms))^2 dt)\n\nAfter performing the integration and solving the equation above, the effective value turns out to be:\nI_avg = (\u221a2 / \u03c0) * (Amplitude) = (\u221a2 / \u03c0) * 4 = (4\u221a2)/\u03c0\n\nHence the effective value of the given current waveform is (4\u221a2)/\u03c0 or approximately 1.8A.\n",

We know that $\\beta = \\frac{I_C}{I_E}$ and we know $\\beta$ and $R_E$, so we first solve for $I_E$:\n\n$I_E = \\frac{I_C}{\\beta} = \\frac{I_C}{60}$\n\nNext, we note that the emitter current, $I_E$, is related to the base current, $I_B$, by $I_E = I_B + I_C$. Rearranging to solve for $I_B$ gives us $I_B = I_E - I_C = \\frac{I_C}{60}-I_C$.\n\nWe also know that $I_B = \\frac{V_{BB}-V_{BE}}{R_B}$ and $V_{BE}=0.3V$, so we can solve for $R_B$:\n\n$R_B = \\frac{V_{BB}-V_{BE}}{I_B} = \\frac{V_{BB}-V_{BE}}{\\frac{I_C}{60}-I_C}$\n\nPlugging in our known values for $V_{BB}$ and $V_{BE}$, and solving for $R_B$ gives us:\n\n$R_B = \\frac{V_{BB}-V_{BE}}{\\frac{I_C}{60}-I_C}= \\frac{15-0.3}{\\frac{I_C}{60}-I_C}=1290\\Omega$\n\nIn summary, we determined the collector current from the given parameters ($\\beta$), the value of $R_E$, and the specified value of $V_{CE}$ (8V).

Increase in Fixed Assets: Since the current excess capacity does not exist, fixed assets must increase at the same rate as sales to accommodate the growth in operations. This means that the additional fixed asset requirement will be $2,000 * (1/2) = $1,000.\n\n3. Increase in Working Capital: Current assets consist of cash, accounts receivable, and inventories. Cash is expected to increase by $100, accounts receivable by $200, and inventories by $200. Thus, the total increase in working capital is $100 + $200 + $200 = $500.\n\nCombining these values, the AFN for the coming year would be:\n$1,000 (increase in fixed assets) + $500 (increase in working capital) - $1,000 * 5% * (1 - 60%) (net income available for reinvestment) = $1,000.\n\nSo, Booth's additional funds needed (AFN) for the coming year is $1,000.\n",

The amount of purchase is 184.25 * 50 = $9,212.50\nBecause the amount of purchase falls into the $800-$2,499 range, his commission is .013 plus $10 up to $65\nThe commission is $27.75\n\nAlternative solution:\nThe price per share for odd lots is $0.75 more than the price for round lots. The sum of each share plus the odd-lot differential is $146.75. He purchases 50 shares, so his base price is $146.75 multiplied by 50.\n\nThen, he sells the stock at $146.75 plus $0.75, or $147.50. His sale price per share is $0.75 more than the price for round lots. \n\nThe amount of money spent on the purchase is $7375. His selling price is $147.50 per share, and he sold 50 shares, for a total sales price of $7375 plus $147.50, or $7522.50.\n\nHis profit is $7522.50 minus $7375. His commission is 0.9% of his profit. His commission is $67.275 or $67.28. The table rounds commissions to the nearest penny.\n",

We can then use these values to calculate the expected completion time for path B-D, based on the fact that it is normally distributed.\n\nGiven that the time it takes to complete an activity follows a normal distribution, the probability that an activity will be completed in a certain amount of time or less can be found by looking up the value in the standard normal distribution table (Z-table). To do this, we must first compute the Z-score for the desired completion time (22 weeks) using the formula: \n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the desired completion time (22 weeks), \u03bc is the mean completion time for the path, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the completion time for the path. Once we have calculated the Z-score, we can look up the corresponding value in the Z-table to find the probability that the path will be completed in 22 weeks or less.\n",

Then, by the Pythagorean theorem we have that \nx2 + y2 = 252 \nDifferentiating both sides with respect to t we get that \n2xx' + 2yy' = 0 \nor solving for x'\nx' = -yy'/x \nSince we are given that y' = -1 and x = 7 when we want to evaluate x', it follows that \nx'(7) = -(25)(-1)/7 = 30/7, or approximately 4.29 feet per second.\nNow, let's test our solution with the given information. The top of the ladder is moving down the wall, the bottom of the ladder is moving towards the bottom of the ladder and therefore away from the wall. Since we have positive values for both y and x', we can say that the slope of the ladder, dy/dx, is negative. The ladder is steeper than the wall, which makes sense since the ladder is slipping faster down the wall. It also shows that (a) and (c) are incorrect answers, while our calculated result of (b) is the only one with a negative slope.\n",
